  Clayton Allen joined Height in May 2017, bringing experience on energy and
  security matters with over six years in government as both a policy advisor in
  the U.S. Senate and a Presidential Appointee in the National Nuclear Security
  Administration (NNSA). 


  In the Senate, Clayton worked for both Senator Mary Landrieu (D-LA) and the
  Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. In these roles, Clayton focused
  on U.S. oil and gas policy, including work streamlining the LNG export regime,
  revising the crude export ban, and updating offshore drilling regulations in
  the wake of the Deepwater Horizon disaster. In addition, Clayton worked
  extensively on U.S. arctic policy, national security and defense, and specific
  factors leading to the growth of ISIL. While at the NNSA, Clayton worked on
  nuclear deterrence provisions of the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act
  as well as on ongoing NNSA counterterrorism, counterproliferation, and treaty
  verification and monitoring activities. 


  Clayton graduated from Louisiana State University with a degree in Political
  Communication, and he is currently completing a MBA at Georgetown.
