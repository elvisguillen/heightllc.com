      We think independently and work collaboratively. The dynamic nature of the
      investment landscape and its abundant data require thoughtfulness and
      agility. Free from traditional constraints of covering a static list of
      companies, issuing ratings, or publishing on earnings results, our
      research team identifies themes and generates ideas opportunistically. We
      provide differentiated and comprehensive insights to help clients make key
      investment and operational decisions.

      and Advisory (IBA) group. Aspiring to be the leading financier and advisor
      in Washington, we set our investment strategy toward the future of global
      markets.
