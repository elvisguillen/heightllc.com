The Takeaway:

In 2018, policymakers at the federal and state levels will continue to focus on drug costs. In Washington, we expect the focus to remain on increasing drug affordability for patients by addressing costs added by the drug supply chain. PhRMA will take advantage of this attention—and a presumed next HHS Secretary who was recently a drug company executive—by advancing some of their longstanding policy goals, specifically around reducing the volume of drugs they are required to sell at a discount. We also expect policies and efforts to encourage biosimilar uptake, allow for innovative drug payment models, and reduce the influence of PBMs. However, this will not come without a cost; we think 2018 could be the year for some wrist-slapping. Specifically, federal policymakers will reduce the ability of brand manufacturers to delay generic and biosimilar competition, and state policymakers will continue to implement price transparency requirements that could ultimately lead to federal transparency measures. This report outlines key opportunities and risks for pharma in 2018.
