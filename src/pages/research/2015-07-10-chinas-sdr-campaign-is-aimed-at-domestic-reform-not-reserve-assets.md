The International Monetary Fund is debating the incorporation of the yuan into the basket of currencies that constitutes the Special Drawing Rights, an international reserve asset created to supplement member countries&#8217; official reserves. But China&#8217;s SDR ambitions have much more to do with financing domestic economic reform than with achieving reserve status for the currency. And its prospects of success depend crucially on sealing a bargain with the United States in top-level bilateral talks scheduled for September.

Recent debate on the Chinese yuan has mainly revolved around its potential to attain reserve currency status by joining the SDR basket, which currently comprises the U.S. dollar, the euro, the British pound and the Japanese yen. The IMF will review the basket&#8217;s composition later this year to assess whether the yuan meets its criteria, including being &#8220;freely usable.&#8221;

But this paints an incomplete picture. While the yuan&#8217;s addition to the SDR would provide a symbolic boost to the currency&#8217;s credibility, it remains unclear whether such a move would lead to a significant increase in yuan reserve holdings worldwide.

SDR assets account for less than 4% of non-gold official foreign exchange reserves. Even if the yuan manages to gain entry into the SDR, it would likely carry a weight of around 10% in the basket. This means that yuan reserve holdings would account for less than 0.4% of non-gold official holdings worldwide. So why is Beijing expending so much political capital on the issue?

The answer lies in the current stress in China&#8217;s financial architecture and Beijing&#8217;s need for additional financing channels to repair the system. The yuan&#8217;s inclusion in the SDR could create new sources of external capital, supporting China&#8217;s deleveraging efforts in the medium-long term.

China&#8217;s investment-led economic model has long relied on massive debt creation, partly fueled by the credit boom following the 2008 financial crisis. The subsequent spiraling of debt has meant that the country&#8217;s ratio of debt to gross domestic product now stands at almost 250%. The strength of the banking system is of particular concern because of bad loans and links between mainstream banks and largely unregulated shadow banks. According to some estimates, real levels of non-performing loans may be as high as 10% of assets, which would be about 10 times the reported level.

As the government aims to put the country on a consumption-driven growth track, a successful transition will increasingly depend on how the financial stresses in the system are managed and the financial architecture is changed to meet the challenges posed by an uncertain global environment. This will entail restructuring debt, recapitalizing banks and local institutions, and creating a marketplace where credit is channeled through market forces and not by government diktat. This is easier said than done.

For almost a year, the government&#8217;s debt-reduction strategy has relied implicitly on the creation of a bull market by relaxing lending norms. A government-induced stock rally allowed Chinese companies to repay debt by issuing new equity that funded mainly by individual investors and households. However, with the ongoing stock market rout leading to trillions of dollars in losses, that experiment is unraveling.

**Household wealth destruction**

Even though indebted companies have benefitted, the recent losses in the value of Chinese shares could lead to a drop in spending by consumers who have lost much of their savings in the highly volatile stock markets. In other words, China&#8217;s deleveraging effort has come at the cost of wealth destruction at the household level, which could depress spending in the near term, just when the government is looking to reorient the economy towards consumption-driven growth.

China needs to fund its domestic restructuring plan using external capital because the current strategy has merely transferred risk from corporations to households. But as growth in China shows signs of a slowdown, capital has started flowing out, instead of coming in. According to the latest data from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, China&#8217;s capital account showed a deficit of $17.9 billion in the first quarter of 2015. An impending interest rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve, possibly in September, is likely to intensify capital outflows in the near-term.

Faced with these challenges and the urgent need to expand financing channels, China needs a magic potion to encourage robust capital inflows in the medium-term without liberalizing its capital account significantly. The incorporation of the yuan into the SDR basket could provide just the medicine that Beijing seeks.

The yuan&#8217;s inclusion would provide legitimacy to the currency and instill confidence in yuan assets worldwide. A recent report by Barclays, entitled &#8220;Beyond SDR: RMB as a safe asset,&#8221; argues that the addition of the yuan (also called the renminbi, or RMB) to the SDR basket could make Chinese government bonds more attractive as part of the global supply of safe assets.

Such a development would be a boon for Chinese policymakers. The increased attractiveness of yuan assets would spur hard currency inflows, expand financing channels, and support debt restructuring efforts and capital injections into the banking sector. The resulting capital inflows could provide China the cushion it needs to effect an economic &#8220;soft landing&#8221; and lay the foundations for a new growth model.

It is in this context that Chinese President Xi Jinping&#8217;s planned bilateral visit to the U.S. in late September assumes significance. The visit will precede the IMF&#8217;s discussions on the SDR in October. With the U.S. enjoying a de facto veto power over the IMF&#8217;s decision, Beijing&#8217;s bid for SDR recognition will depend largely on how bilateral negotiations between the two countries advance between now and September.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said earlier this year that despite Beijing&#8217;s efforts, the government has more work to do to internationalize the yuan. On the other hand, China&#8217;s central bank governor, Zhou Xiaochuan, has urged the IMF to change its conventional view on cross-border capital controls and instead adopt a concept of &#8220;managed convertibility.&#8221; The latter would allow the yuan to satisfy the IMF&#8217;s &#8220;free usability&#8221; requirement for inclusion in the SDR without China having to further liberalize its capital markets in the near-term.

Since views on the subject remain divergent, the negotiations leading up to Xi&#8217;s summit meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama will likely involve tough bargains on either side. Washington will make concessions on the yuan&#8217;s inclusion in the SDR if China demonstrates willingness to address cyber security issues and alter its aggressive geopolitical posture in Asia.
