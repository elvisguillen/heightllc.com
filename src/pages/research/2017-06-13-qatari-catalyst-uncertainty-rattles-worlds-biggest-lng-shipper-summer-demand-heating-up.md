The Takeaway:

Last week, six Arab countries abruptly severed diplomatic ties with Qatar, allegedly over Qatar’s support for organizations regarded as terrorist, including the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas. Several of these countries, including the UAE and Egypt, are prominent importers of Qatari LNG and natural gas. Globally, Qatar is the largest LNG supplier with nearly 80 million metric tons (mtpa) exported last year, representing over 30% of the supply in the 263 mtpa global market. So far, LNG exports from Qatar continue relatively unimpeded, though the UAE imposed a ban on all vessels heading to or coming from Qatar and blocked access to a key refueling port in Fujairah. Tensions between Qatar and the blockade countries have not cooled, despite attempts by Kuwait and the U.S. State Department to mediate. Regardless of Qatar’s assurances that the blockade will not affect LNG shipments, we believe that this unprecedented blockade casts uncertainty over Qatar’s ability to meet summer demand requirements. This uncertainty creates an opportunity for the U.S. to prove its mettle among risk-averse Asian LNG buyers heading into the tight summer demand season.
