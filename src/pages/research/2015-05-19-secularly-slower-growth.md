        <em><strong>Summary:</strong></em>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Larry Summers has made quite a splash in the economics world with his <a href="http://larrysummers.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/NABE-speech-Lawrence-H.-Summers1.pdf" target="_blank">secular stagnation hypothesis</a>. While I agree with much of what Mr. Summers posits (and in this piece discuss several of the factors also cited by Mr. Summers) I am a bit less pessimistic than he appears to be, thus “secularly slower growth” seems a more apt label for my point of view. U.S. economic growth is likely to be significantly slower in the coming decade than it had been in the decades leading up to the Great Recession and financial crisis. While other factors also come into play, debt dynamics and demographics explain much of this (expected) downshift in growth. The implications for financial markets are likely to be a lower equilibrium real rate of interest (though perhaps not as destabilizing low as Mr. Summers fears may be the case) and a comparatively modest return from the S&P 500 over the next decade.

                <em><strong>Debt Dynamics</strong></em>
              </p>
              
              <p>
                As noted above, debt dynamics and demographics go a long way in explaining why U.S. economic growth is likely to be significantly slower over the coming decade than was the case in the decades preceding the financial crisis and Great Recession. To start with debt dynamics, and to begin with the beginning:
              </p>
              
              <p>
                In 1971 President Richard Milhous Nixon ended U.S. dollar convertibility to gold. As is illustrated in Figure 1, this untethering of the U.S. dollar to gold effectively enabled as much U.S. dollar credit creation as the world desired (and, in my view, as evidenced by the financial crisis ultimately resulted in more credit creation than the world could bear).
              </p>
              
              <p>
                When I visit clients I almost always bring a slide deck along. While slides enter and exit my “roadshow presentation” depending on what, at any particular point in time, is interesting and relevant, for most of the 2000’s one graph was a constant in my presentations: U.S. domestic nonfinancial debt as a percentage of U.S. nominal GDP, shown below as Figure 2. Prior to the financial crisis I would typically bring this graph to the attention of whomever I was speaking with and offer brief commentary akin to the following: “I just want to make you aware of this. This upward trajectory in the debt-to-GDP ratio is not sustainable. I can’t tell you when it will end, but when it does end it will probably end badly. Give me any country on the planet, let me run up the debt-to-GDP ratio, and I can show you a rapid pace of GDP growth, too.”
              </p>
              
              <p>
                The bad end, of course, began in 2007 and culminated in 2008. The point being that a change in debt dynamics is one reason U.S. economic growth is likely to be slower over the next decade than was the case in the decades leading up to the financial crisis and Great Recession (as can be seen in Figure 2, the overall increase in leverage really began in the early 1980’s).
              </p>

              </p>
              
              <p>
                Please also note that it does not require actual “deleveraging” (a decline in the absolute value of debt outstanding or decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio) for growth to be slower in the future than it has been in the past. All it takes is an absence of more leveraging (that is, that the debt-to-GDP ratio remains constant or declines).
              </p>
              
              <p>
                As is illustrated by the solid blue line in Figure 2, the ratio of total U.S. domestic nonfinancial debt to nominal GDP has been more or less stable over the past several years. The ratio of household debt to GDP, however, has declined from a high of 95.53% as of 2Q 2009 to 76.24% as of 4Q 2014 (the solid blue line in Figure 3). While recognizing that declining petroleum imports have certainly contributed to the improvement in the U.S. trade deficit over the past couple of years, Figure 3, which plots household debt as a percentage of GDP against U.S. net exports (the trade deficit) as a percentage of GDP (on an inverted scale), suggests that relative deleveraging on the part of U.S. households is contributing to the improvement in the U.S. trade deficit.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                A smaller drag from the net export line item has, in recent years, helped offset some of the negative consequences of household deleveraging on U.S. GDP growth, but it has also contributed to slower growth in the rest of the world as now-deleveraging U.S. households are no longer the globe’s vendor-financed buyers of last resort (or, at least, act as such to a lesser degree). Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis has an interesting hypothesis he calls the “Global Minotaur” in which he posits that, having reached the limits of debt and credit creation, the U.S. is no longer able to “recycle” the surpluses created by the rest of the world, resulting in slower global growth. While the interplay among all the relevant factors and feedback loops is beyond the scope of this piece, it is worth noting that slower global growth incentivizes “currency wars”, which (other than in times when the U.S. and the Fed are active “combatants”) ultimately results in a stronger U.S. dollar and slower U.S. growth.

                Over the long run the actual growth rate of real GDP is more or less equal to the potential growth rate of real GDP. The total potential growth rate of real GDP is the sum of the growth rate of labor plus the growth rate of productivity.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                The CBO (Congressional Budget Office) projections [which can be found in the CBO’s January 2015 report The Budget and Economic Outlook 2015 to 2025 which can be accessed <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/topics/economy" target="_blank">here</a>] estimate that the average annual growth rate of potential real GDP between 2015 and 2025 is +2.1%, with an average annual labor force growth rate of +0.5% and an average annual labor force productivity growth rate of +1.6%. Per the CBO’s estimates between 1950 and 2014 the potential growth rate of real GDP was +3.3%, with potential labor force growth of +1.5%, and potential productivity growth of +1.8%. So, while potential productivity growth over the next decade is expected to be 0.2% below its long-term average, the big “hit” to potential GDP over the next decade comes from lower potential labor force growth (expected to be full percentage point below its long-term average).
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Comparing the CBO’s estimate of potential real GDP as of 4Q 2014 ($16,690 billion) with the actual level of real GDP as of 4Q 2014 ($16,295 billion) one can calculate that the real GDP output gap as of 4Q 2014 was -2.06% of potential real GDP. The CBO projects that actual real GDP will grow at a pace in excess of its potential growth rate over the next couple of years and that the negative real GDP output gap will essentially close by 2Q 2017. Using actual quarterly CBO projections over the next 10 years (1Q 2015 through 1Q 2025) I calculate that the CBO is projecting:
              </p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>
                  An annualized pace (CAGR) of actual real GDP growth of +2.32%.
                </li>
                <li>
                  An annualized pace (CAGR) of growth in the civilian noninstitutional population (aged 16 years and older) of 0.96% (please see Figure 4).
                </li>
                <li>
                  An annualized pace (CAGR) of labor force growth of +0.62% (please see Figure 5)
                </li>
              </ul>
              
              <p>
                The reason the CBO projection for labor force growth over the next 10 years (+0.62% annualized) is below its estimate for population growth (+0.96%) is because the CBO projects that the labor force participation rate will continue to decline (please see Figure 6).
              </p>
              
              <p>
                I’ll note here that for much of the post-WWII period the opposite was true, that is, the labor force grew at a faster pace than the working-age population. Between December 1950 and December 2000 the labor force increased at a +1.69% annualized rate while working-age population increased at a +1.43% annualized rate, a differential of +0.25% which can be seen as adding 0.25% to the growth rate of potential GDP. Between December 1970 and December 2000 that differential was +0.35% (labor force growth of +1.81% versus working-age population growth of +1.46%). This was (as can be seen in Figure 7) completely due to a long-term increase in the labor force participation rate of working-age women (the labor force participation rate of working age men has been in a long-term decline).
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Having peaked at 60.3% in April 2000 the labor force participation rate of working-age women stood at 56.6% as of March 2015, thus it would appear that this boost to the potential (and ultimately, actual) pace of real GDP growth ended some 15 years ago.

              <p>
                I’ll further note, as can be seen in Figure 8, that about the time the labor force participation rate of working-age women peaked the ratio of domestic nonfinancial debt to GDP began its most recent (last?) leg up. So, just as the boost to real GDP growth from the rising women’s labor force participation rate was wearing off, a new boost was introduced in the form of debt / leverage (this arguably kept the importance of the prior contribution to real GDP growth from the heretofore increase in women’s participation in the workforce from being fully appreciated at the time).

                <em><strong>Income Inequality</strong></em>
              </p>
              
              <p>
                One of the major problems in both the U.S. economy and the global economy is a shortage of demand. I posit that the more money that finds its way into the hands of people who will actually spend it (people with a high propensity to consume &#8211; like most low and moderate-income Americans), the faster demand will grow.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Figure 9 depicts my “Marxist Chart” which I use as gauge to measure the current state of the perennial tug-of-war between labor (which, for the most part, has a high propensity to consume) and capital. As can be seen in Figure 9, the corporate profits ratio (pre-tax corporate profits of domestic corporate business with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments as a percentage of the net value added of domestic corporate business) has been elevated since 2010 (and very elevated since late 2011) while the employee compensation ratio (compensation of employees as a percentage of the net value added of domestic corporate business) has been depressed since 2010 (and very depressed since late 2011).
              </p>
              
              <p>
                <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-498" src="https://heightllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/fig9.png" alt="fig9" width="565" height="457" />
              </p>
              
              <p>
                While it is in the best self-interest of individual corporations to keep labor costs as low as possible and profit margins as high as possible, the paradox is that the collective interest of the society as a whole (and to the extent that corporations are now “eating their seed corn” perhaps, ultimately, even the individual interests of the individual corporations themselves) would arguably be better served, and the collective economic pie would grow more rapidly, if labor were to receive a bigger slice of the pie.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                As can be seen in Figure 9, in the past the employee compensation ratio and the corporate profit ratio have been both inverse and cyclical. However, as I have previously noted, both have remained at relatively extreme levels for some time now. Hopefully this phenomenon will continue to be cyclical and not turn out to be a new feature of the secular landscape, as I posit that to the extent that the present situation persists future real GDP growth will be slower than would otherwise be the case. I have no data to back up the following assertion / speculation but it may well be that income inequality (of which my Marxist Chart is just one manifestation) is going beyond merely inhibiting income flow to those with a higher propensity to spend, but may also be inhibiting credit creation and a faster recovery in the housing market. The following is a passage from a Market News International story which appeared earlier this week. “Shiller” is Nobel Laureate Dr. Robert Shiller (also of Case-Shiller Home Price Index fame):
              </p>
              
              <p>
                “<em>In relation to housing&#8217;s weakness and in a broader context, worldwide economic weakness, Shiller proposed a theory to the conference. He sees, he said, a fear of the job-eliminating threat of new technology combined with the fear of losing out to increasing income inequality, with an income gap that seems to be leaving a lot of people heading down while others soar.</em>
              </p>
              
              <p>
                <em> The result, Shiller said, is a worldwide surge in savings. Because of the well-known paradox of thrift, which benefits the individual and strangles the economy, entire economies are being starved of demand.</em>”
              </p>
              
              <p>
                <strong>Corporate Profits and the S&P 500</strong>
              </p>
              
              <p>
                So if GDP growth is expected to be slower over the next decade than has been the case over the past several decades, what might we expect for corporate profit growth and the performance of the S&P 500?
              </p>
              
              <p>
                As regular readers are no doubt aware, when measuring corporate profits I am partial to what I (and some others) refer to as “NIPA” profits: U.S. corporate profits with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments as recorded by the Bureau of Economic Analysis in its National Income and Product Account (or “NIPA”) tables.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                In addition to the economic data already discussed, the CBO also makes projections for future levels of NIPA profits (as well as other economic data). One caveat I should point out here (which applies to all of the CBO’s projections, not just its NIPA profits projections) is that the CBO does not project recessions, so all of its economic projections assume that no recession occurs over the next 10 years. With that disclaimer:
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Over the past 20 years (from 4Q 1994 through 4Q 2014) NIPA profits increased at a +6.03% annualized rate. The CBO projects that over the next 10 years (from 1Q 2015 through 1Q 2025) NIPA profits will increase at a +2.51% annualized rate (CAGR), or less than half the annualized growth rate seen over the past 20 years. Per the CBO’s projections, NIPA profit growth over the next 10 years will be back loaded, with a +1.72% annualized growth rate between 1Q 2015 and 1Q 2020 and a +3.31% annualized growth rate between 1Q 2020 and 1Q 2025 (please see Figure 10).
              </p>
              
              <p>
                <img class="alignnone wp-image-499 size-full" src="https://heightllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/fig10.png" alt="fig10" width="569" height="457" />
              </p>
              
              <p>
                As regular readers are also aware, I use NIPA profits as the X variable in my regression-driven S&P 500 valuation model to determine the “model value” of the S&P 500 (the Y variable). As is illustrated in Figure 11, the actual average closing level of the S&P 500 in 4Q 2014 (the most recent quarter for which actual NIPA profits data is currently available) was 2009.34 versus the 4Q 2014 model value of 1907.68. As is illustrated in Figure 12, as of 4Q 2014 the relative valuation of the S&P 500 (that is, the actual average closing level of the S&P 500 as a percentage of the model value) was 105.3%.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-500" src="https://heightllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/fig11.png" alt="fig11" width="567" height="451" />
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Plugging the CBO’s projections for the quarterly levels of NIPA profits into the model we can come up with a hypothetical projection for at least the model value of the S&P 500 over the next 10 years (please see Figure 13).
              </p>
              
              <p>
                The projected S&P 500 model value 10 years from now (in 1Q 2025) shown in Figure 13 is 2552. If in fact the actual S&P 500 were to average 2552 in 1Q 2025, that would represent a 23.67% increase from the average closing level in 1Q 2015 of 2064, or a +2.15% annualized (CAGR) simple price return (does not include dividends) over the next decade. For comparison, consider that over the past 10 years (1Q 2005 through 1Q 2015) the simple price return on the S&P 500 has been +73.14% (5.64% CAGR) and that over the past 20 years (1Q 1995 through 1Q 2015) the simple price return has been 329.51% (7.56% CAGR).
              </p>
              
              <p>
                The future, as always, is opaque and the hypothetical future returns discussed above are based on projections of NIPA profits that may or may not come to fruition. That having been said, with the expected evolution of debt dynamics and demographics (and potentially income inequality, as well) suggesting slower GDP growth than has been the case in the past, it makes intuitive sense that expected returns from the S&P 500 would be lower than in the past, as well.

                <strong>The Equilibrium Real Interest Rate</strong>
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Given that the FOMC has an official inflation target of 2%, and that the median “longer run” expectation for the level of the fed funds rate in the FOMC’s most recent (March 18, 2015) Summary of Economic Projections is 3.75%, one can conclude that the in the aggregate / collective judgment of the FOMC the “longer run” real risk-free rate is 1.75%. In a comparatively (that is, compared to the last several decades) slower growing world, encumbered by an excess of savings and a dearth of demand, in which traditional investments (equities and bonds) can be expected to produce lower returns than most have heretofore considered to be “normal”, a 1.75% real risk-free rate seems high (or optimistic) to me.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                I do not know, nor does anyone else know, what the appropriate / natural / neutral real risk-free rate is likely to be on average over the next decade. I am expecting that there will be growth, although at a very modest pace once the negative real GDP output gap has closed (until that gap closes, however, I wouldn’t rule out the possibility of +3% real GDP growth). All in all, I am inclined to believe that the real risk-free rate is probably not below zero. At the same time I think that on average over the next decade growth will be slow enough (and aggregate savings high enough) that the equilibrium risk-free rate will probably not be above (or much above) 1%. For now I’ll simply split the difference and assume an equilibrium risk-free rate of 0.5%.<br /> Right now the balance of risks appears to continue to be toward disinflation, or the persistence of an undesirably low (from the Fed’s perspective, anyway) pace of inflation, but I am expecting to see a faster pace of U.S. wage inflation. Thus I am willing to give the Fed the benefit of the doubt and assume that the Fed’s 2% inflation target will be met and maintained (the biggest risk I see on this front is the potential for China to join the currency wars after this fall’s decision regarding the inclusion of the yuan in the SDR, but that’s a topic for another day).
              </p>
              
              <p>
                My assumption that inflation will run at 2%, coupled with my assumption that the equilibrium real risk-free rate will be 0.5%, suggests that the terminal nominal fed funds rate (the nominal level of the fed funds rate once the presumed tightening cycle is complete) should be 2.5%.

                <strong>Summary and Conclusions</strong>
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Predicting the future (and oftentimes in economics, it seems, even accurately perceiving the present) can be a difficult endeavor. It may turn out be that Larry Summers secular stagnation thesis is completely correct (I agree with much of what Mr. Summers has to say) and the equilibrium real rate of interest required to achieve full employment is too low to be consistent with financial stability.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                My own point of view, and outlook for the future, is I think best described by the title of this piece, “Secularly Slower Growth”: The secular economic trends, mainly less leverage and demographics, will likely result in slower growth than has heretofore been the norm but, while low in comparison to the decades leading up to the Great Recession and Financial Crisis, the equilibrium real rate of interest will likely be positive and thus (while such an outcome can’t be entirely ruled out) I harbor less fear of resultant financial instability, or at least financial instability resulting from low rates. I think the Fed will gradually raise rates over the next few years, and I fully expect to see market volatility as a result, but such does not in my lexicon rise to the level of “financial instability”.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                For investors, the most salient feature of my outlook is that slow-growth will, going forward, likely be reflected in lower rates of return from “traditional” equity investments such as the S&P 500. Yes, over the past several years we’ve had slow real GDP growth along with a roaring stock market but, as can be seen in Figures 11 and 12, per my model the S&P 500 was significantly undervalued from 1Q 2009 through 3Q 2013 (and still a bit undervalued in 4Q 2013). Such is no longer the case. Going forward the level of the S&P 500 is (in my view) is likely to be more aligned with (a comparatively slow pace of) profit growth.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                As for bonds (Treasuries): Given my outlook for the future path of the fed funds rate (and assuming little or no term premium in a world awash with savings and a seeming dearth of top-quality fixed income instruments) the present yield of the 10-year Treasury seems reasonable, but with an even modest (presumed) Fed tightening cycle ahead of us, the risk to bond prices probably lies on the downside.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                In the future I envision both nominal and real rates will rise somewhat (probably more in the short end of the curve than the long end) but nonetheless remain low by historical standards, and with returns from “traditional” investments also low by historical standards, those desiring (or needing) the types of returns we became accustomed to in the “good old days” will likely need to broaden their investment horizons, assume more risk, and / or simply work harder at investing. Alternative investments, special situations, M&A opportunities, strategic opportunities in emerging market stocks and bonds, and good old-fashioned domestic stock-picking will likely be the mines that produce the highest quality diamonds.
