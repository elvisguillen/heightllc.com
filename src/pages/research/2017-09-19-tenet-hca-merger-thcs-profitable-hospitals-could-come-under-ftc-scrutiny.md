**_The Takeaway:_**

_Tenet Healthcare **(THC)**, facing pressure from activist shareholders, is exploring strategic options including a possible sale of the company. One possibility making the rounds is a potential acquisition of THC&#8217;s hospital assets by Hospital Corporation of America <strong)(HCA), a mega-merger that would likely draw scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). In this report, we analyze the overlap of THC&#8217;s and HCA&#8217;s hospital assets to identify potential areas of concern for antitrust regulators. We find that the merger will likely attract scrutiny in six local markets: Miami-Date (FL), Palm Beach Region (FL), Bexar County Region (TX), Cameron County Area (TX), El Paso County (TX), and Charleston/Mt. Pleasant Area (SC). Based on our assessment, seventeen THC facilities will likely receive scrutiny from the FTC. These hospitals are some of the most profitable in the THC portfolio._

**Background &#8211; FTC&#8217;s Hospital Merger Framework**

In a hospital merger case, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) defines the relevant service market as general acute care (GAC) inpatient services provided to commercial payers. GAC inpatient hospital services include, but are not limited to, emergency services, internal medicine services, and surgical procedures offered by hospitals. Importantly, outpatient services are not included in the GAC inpatient hospital services market.

The appropriate geographic market that the FTC considers when analyzing hospital merger cases is the area where a hypothetical monopolist of the GAC inpatient services could profitably impose a small but significant and non-transitory increase in price (“SSNIP”) for commercial payers. According to the FTC, if a hypothetical monopolist could impose a SSNIP, the boundaries of that geographic area are an appropriate geographic market.

The FTC’s merger framework on hospital mergers has [evolved](https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/healthlaw/06_evolution_of_market_definition_in_healthcare_provider_transactions.authcheckdam.pdf) over the past several years, withstanding legal challenge at the circuit level. In September 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit upheld the FTC’s view in the merger case involving two Pennsylvania hospitals: Penn State Hershey Medical Center (Hershey) and PinnacleHealth System (Pinnacle). Similarly, the FTC secured another victory later that year when the Seventh Circuit overturned a district court decision against the FTC, finding that the district court committed errors in its geographic market finding. In other words, the FTC’s present thinking around relevant **<u>service</u>** and **<u>geographic</u>** markets to conduct a hospital merger analysis has received approval from the higher judiciary.

**Methodology**

For our analysis, we identified a total of 226 acute care hospitals that are currently affiliated to HCA (150) and THC (76). See [<u>HERE</u>](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1eJ0G_QVac3Okew2qWC66a7pnraQ&ll=46.24754502291535%2C-110.30936530000002&z=3) for a visual representation of the overlap between HCA’s and THC’s hospitals assets.

Investors would note that the FTC’s merger analysis relies heavily on insurer claims data to track share of commercial GAC inpatient admissions in a relevant geographic market. Since claims data are not publicly available, we relied upon total discharges reported by hospitals in their Medicare Cost Reports to estimate market share of individual acute care hospitals.

The geographic market for inpatient GAC services is no easier to define and is more often in dispute among parties during litigation. In past cases where the FTC tasted success, the agency relied on testimony of representatives from managed care organizations (MCOs) stating the impossibility of creating a viable network without the hospitals in question. Such a scenario, as described by the MCO representatives, would provide the merging hospitals in the said geographic market with greater leverage in negotiating payer rates. As a result, the merger would result in a significant and non-transitory increase in price (“SSNIP”) for commercial payers. To define the relevant geographic area for our analysis of a potential HCA-THC merger, we studied states’ Medicaid contracting frameworks to identify appropriate geographic markets (discussed in greater detail below).

A cursory look at the [<u>visual map</u>](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1eJ0G_QVac3Okew2qWC66a7pnraQ&ll=46.24754502291535%2C-110.30936530000002&z=3) reveals that the HCA-THC combination could potentially raise antitrust issues in Florida, Texas, South Carolina and California. We, therefore, restricted our analysis to these four states.

**Results**

**<u>Florida</u>**

According to Florida&#8217;s [<u>Statewide Medicaid Managed Care (SMMC) Program</u>](http://ahca.myflorida.com/Medicaid/statewide_mc/pdf/SMMC_Region_map.pdf), the state awards managed care contracts to private companies across 11 regions (see figure 1)

**Figure 1: Florida County Map for Medicaid Managed Care**

Based on the above classification and the location of HCA and THC hospitals in Florida, we focused our merger analysis to three relevant geographic markets: Miami-Dade County, Broward County, and the 5-county region comprised of Palm Beach, Martin, St. Lucie, Indian River and Okeechobee counties.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-923" src="https://heightllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/figure-1A-miami-dade-full-3.png" alt="" width="635" height="546" />

Per FTC’s Horizontal Merger guidelines, the above market is a _moderately concentrated market_ that involves an increase of HHI of more than 100 points. Therefore, the merger could potentially raise significant competitive concerns in Miami-Dade county and warrant scrutiny from the FTC.

<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>B. Broward County Region</strong><br /> We find that there is no overlap between THC and HCA hospitals in Broward county.

The merger would result in a _highly concentrated market_ that involves an increase of HHI of more than 100 points. Therefore, an HCA-THC merger will almost definitely raise anticompetitive concerns in the 5-county region defined above.

**<u>Texas</u>**

According to the [<u>Texas Health and Human Service Commission</u>](http://www.tcdd.texas.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/C-Managed-Care-Service-Areas-Map.pdf), the states operates its managed care program across 13 regions (see figure 2)

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-894" src="https://heightllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Figure-2-tx-managed-care.png" alt="" width="659" height="464" />

Based on the above classification and the location of HCA and THC hospitals in Texas, we focused our merger analysis to six relevant geographic markets: Bexar Country Region, El Paso County, Cameron County Region, Harris County Region, Tarrant County Region and the Dallas County Region.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-895" src="https://heightllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Figure-2A-bexar-county-region.png" alt="" width="629" height="470" />

A merger or acquisition is presumed to create or enhance market power when the post-acquisition HHI exceeds 2,500 points and the merger or acquisition increases the HHI by more than 200 points. Here, the market concentration levels far exceed these thresholds.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-925" src="https://heightllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/figure-2B-el-paso-2.png" alt="" width="632" height="280" />

In this case, the post-acquisition HHI exceeds 2,500 points and the merger or acquisition increases the HHI by more than 200 points.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-898" src="https://heightllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Figure-2C-cameron-county.png" alt="" width="629" height="394" />

In this case, the merger results in a _highly concentrated_ market with an increase in the HHI of more than 200 points.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-926" src="https://heightllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Figure-D-harris-county.png" alt="" width="627" height="794" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-927" src="https://heightllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/figure-D-2.png" alt="" width="626" height="203" />

In this case, the merger results in a _moderately concentrated_ market with an increase in the HHI of less than 200 points. Therefore, this market will likely escape further scrutiny from the FTC.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-928" src="https://heightllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Figure-2E-tarrant.png" alt="" width="642" height="818" /><img class="alignnone wp-image-930" src="https://heightllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/figure-2d-tarrant-continued.png" alt="" width="643" height="201" />

In this case, the merger results in a _moderately concentrated_ market with an increase in the HHI of less than 100 points. Therefore, this market will likely escape further scrutiny from the FTC.

<img class="size-full wp-image-931 alignnone" src="https://heightllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/figure-F-Dallas.png" alt="" width="636" height="829" /><img class="wp-image-933 alignnone" src="https://heightllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Figure-F-dallas-continued-1.png" alt="" width="637" height="342" />

In this case, the merger results in a _moderately concentrated_ market with an increase in the HHI of little more than 200 points. In our view, the above market is likely to escape FTC scrutiny since the increase in HHI is close to the threshold value.

**<u>South Carolina</u>**

We understand that South Carolina contracts out its managed care plans across each of its counties (see [<u>HERE</u>](https://www.scdhhs.gov/internet/pdf/MC%20Plans%20by%20County%20July%202010.pdf) and [<u>HERE</u>](http://www.molinahealthcare.com/members/sc/en-US/mem/medicaid/overvw/care/Pages/servicearea.aspx)). And according to the state&#8217;s Medicaid [<u>website</u>](https://www.scchoices.com/Member/Step3PBECompare.aspx?SliceAttribute=6&program=4), all the five private plans serve all the counties in SC.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-899" src="https://heightllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Figure-3-SC-managed-care.png" alt="" width="662" height="460" />

While each county could serve as a relevant geographic market, the fact that all commercial plans operating in SC serve all the counties in the state means that providers and MCOs will negotiate payer rates based on patient flow data alone. In other words, driving vicinity would play a key role in determining a relevant geographic market. In this context, we identified all hospitals within 30-mile driving distance from individual THC facilities. This yielded a list of six hospitals with Trident Medical Center as the sole hospital affiliated to HCA.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-934" src="https://heightllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/charleston-figure.png" alt="" width="638" height="256" />
  
In this case, the merger results in a _highly concentrated_ market with an increase in the HHI of more than 200 points. In our view, the above market is likely to raise significant competitive concerns and will most almost definitely warrant scrutiny from the FTC.

**_California_**

There are 19 insurance rating [regions](https://www.coveredca.com/news/PDFs/CoveredCA_2018_Plans_and_Rates_8-1-2017.pdf) for California&#8217;s individual and small group plans across counties.

**Figure 4: California Rating Regions**
  
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-903" src="https://heightllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Figure-4-cali-rating.png" alt="" width="450" height="452" />
  
Based on the above regional classification and the location of THC and HCA facilities in the state, we find that Los Angeles county is the only geographic region where there is an overlap between the two companies. However, on closer examination, we find that each of the two facilities (affiliated to THC and HCA respectively) that are located in LA county account for less than 1% of the total discharges in the county. Therefore, a potential HCA-THC merger would hardly raise any anticompetitive concerns among antitrust regulators in this local market.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-905" src="https://heightllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/figure-4-LA-1.png" alt="" width="579" height="160" />

**Conclusion**

In Figure 5 below, we list all the seventeen THC facilities that, according to our assessment, will receive scrutiny from the FTC. As Figure 5 illustrates, some of the most profitable THC facilities are located in markets that overlap with HCA assets. A potential HCA-THC combination could, therefore, have to divest profitable hospitals in order to remedy anticompetitive concerns that regulators may raise.
