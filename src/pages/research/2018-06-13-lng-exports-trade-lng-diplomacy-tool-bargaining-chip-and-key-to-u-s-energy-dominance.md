The Takeaway: 

Energy exporters are beginning to feel the strain of trade tensions between the US and China. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporters, in particular, will depend heavily on Chinese demand growth, both directly and indirectly. Trade tensions could complicate things, however. We doubt that China will target US natural gas directly, but skittishness over tough trade rhetoric between the US and China may discourage investment in
projects that are levered to the Chinese market. Should trade negotiations lead to Chinese concessions to increase imports of US goods, we believe LNG could benefit substantially
as energy exports could meaningfully erode the US trade deficit with China. China is one of the fastest growing importers of LNG, passing South Korea as the second-largest importer of LNG last year. Gas demand in the world’s most populous country is unlikely to decline, and state targets indicate that demand could continue its stratospheric pace of growth. The question becomes from where can China source gas in sufficient supply
to meet its needs. We continue to believe the LNG market, where the US is on track to be the largest exporter by the mid-2020s, is the most likely source of natural gas for China’s growing market. Consequently, while we believe the opportunity for exporters remains robust, projects and their financiers must navigate trade tensions carefully and creatively.
