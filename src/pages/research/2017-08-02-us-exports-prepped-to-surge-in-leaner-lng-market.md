The Takeaway:

_There are several truths known to be self-evident in the world of LNG: first, demand is rising quickly due to a variety of economic and political factors; second, near-term oversupply will give way to an aggregate supply deficit, probably by the early 2020s; and third, LNG export terminals require years to build, and secure, long-term contracts. This framework is widely accepted by players in the LNG market – buyers know they can’t wave a “magic wand” and cause LNG capacity to appear when they need it. All the same, buyers also know that many of the proposed and rumored export projects will not make it to a final investment decision. Indeed, picking a project to sign on with is like betting on horses. Ultimately, buyers must balance a project’s estimated pricing while determining whether it is likely to meet its gas production targets on time and on budget. On a certain level, buyers are running out of time. Certain markets are growing rapidly, while others are stagnant or shrinking, and volumes are not perfectly fungible between countries. Additionally, the increasingly seasonal market suggests that a season’s or short-term supply deficit could precede the deficit in aggregate supply by several years (our model suggests 2019). We believe the US is uniquely positioned to take advantage of this window of economic and political opportunity, despite the bruising, low-priced LNG spot market that has claimed so many projects around the world._
