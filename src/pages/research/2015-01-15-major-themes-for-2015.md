                In this report, we highlight some of the key themes within the healthcare sector, as well as our thoughts around those drivers on which we believe investors should focus to successfully navigate the challenging waters we see ahead, including innovation, quality improvement, efficiency, and cost-lowering. The sector themes include a continued rate of muted healthcare utilization, ongoing focus and scrutiny on drug pricing, the impact from biosimilars, legislative actions affecting the Affordable Care Act, and the implications of the upcoming King v. Burwell Supreme Court decision, to name a few. The healthcare space is entering a phase in which there will be unprecedented growth combined with a need to drive down costs and inefficiencies in the system.

          Over the last three years the healthcare sector has been one of the best performing subsectors, with the S&P 500 Healthcare Index outperforming the S&P 500 Index by nearly 40 percent over that timeframe. The performance in the sector has come from the U.S. Supreme Court upholding the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in July 2012 as well as the realization by many investors of the strong demographic tailwinds (discussed below) not only here in the United States but also in the rest of the world that will contribute to significant future growth. As a result, investors have been pouring money into the sector; the S&P 500 Healthcare Index is at an all-time high and trading at a peak multiple. The growth tailwinds are undeniable and the enthusiasm is warranted, but we think selectivity and caution are also warranted as the rising tide of valuations in the sector have lifted all boats. In terms of company characteristics, we believe the winning themes – not just for 2015 but for several years beyond – include innovation, quality improvement, efficiency, and cost-lowering. The healthcare sector is reaching a phase in which there will be unprecedented growth combined with a real need to drive down costs and inefficiencies in the system. Additionally, political wrangling in Washington over the future of the ACA and the upcoming Supreme Court decision in the King v. Burwell case are likely to add a layer of concern and controversy.

                            The U.S. healthcare system is the largest, most complicated healthcare system in the world. It is also unlike any other healthcare system in the world, as the majority of reimbursement is based on a private insurance system, unlike a nationalized, government-centric, single- payer system in many parts of the world. What makes the system even more unusual is that the United States is the only country with a fee-for-service based system. Fee-for-service is a system wherein providers are reimbursed for each and every service and or product they provide or prescribe. That means the more you prescribe or use services, the more you get paid. That is unlike the rest of the world where it’s more bundled, and providers are paid a set fee for care regardless of how many services you provide. In essence, providers are incentivized in this country to use services because they get paid to use them. So, as the table below illustrates, it shouldn’t come as any surprise that as a nation we spend more per capita on healthcare – by a wide margin – versus every industrialized country in the world.

                                  One would think all this money would translate into better outcomes and higher quality healthcare, but that is not the case. Despite all the money we spend on healthcare, the data and the facts don’t lie, revealing the U.S. healthcare system as one of the least efficient and lowest quality healthcare systems in the industrialized world. A study done in 2010 by the Commonwealth Fund showed we have nearly twice as many preventable deaths (96/100,000) versus France (55/100,000), and a higher infant mortality rate versus other developed nations. A study done in 2014, also by the Commonwealth Fund, this time focused on seniors, found a similar, disconcerting trend. The results showed Americans over the age of 65 were sicker and less able to afford healthcare versus seniors in other developed countries. Specifically, 9 in 10 seniors in the United States suffer from a chronic condition, and 2/3 have more than one while 50% of seniors take 4 or more medications for these conditions; that is more than any other country. The United States also ranks near the bottom in access to healthcare for its citizens. The key takeaway here is we spend much more than the rest of the world, yet have one of the world’s worst healthcare systems. Clearly, there is a lot of waste and inefficiency in the system that needs to be wrung out.

                                        Over the next several years, the healthcare system is expected to experience unprecedented growth as the U.S. population ages, an increased number of the uninsured become insured via the ACA (Affordable Care Act), and the obesity epidemic continues to rage on. Currently, the U.S. elderly population makes up roughly 13% of the overall population and by 2020 is expected to make up 17% of the population. What’s most important is not the growth in the population, but the overall increase in healthcare expenditures this demographic brings. According to a study published in Health Affairs, annual healthcare costs per person for the elderly are approximately three-times higher than the working population (ages 19-64): $14,797 versus $4,500. The Affordable Care Act, which was passed in 2010, and upheld by the Supreme Court in 2012, will eventually add roughly 30M previously uninsured individuals to the paying rolls. Lastly, the obesity epidemic in the United States shows no signs of slowing down, and will add a significant cost and utilization burden to the system. Based on the latest data, obese and overweight individuals make up roughly 37% of the U.S. population and 61% of total healthcare expenditures. A recent report by the CBO (Congressional Budget Office) forecast health expenditures to grow by 68% by 2020 as the prevalence of obesity rises. Based on the stats discussed earlier, adding more people to a broken system will just add fuel to an already out-of-control fire. The ACA (discussed in detail below) was designed to address the access issue but nothing as of yet has been done or put in place to reduce the cost curve and increase quality, effectiveness, and efficiency in the overall system. It’s these realities that will need to be addressed going forward to continue sustainability of the healthcare system.

                                              In 2013, the U.S. spent roughly $2.9 trillion, or $9,255 per person on healthcare expenditures; this comprised roughly 17% of GDP. Of the $2.9 trillion in expenditures in 2013, the majority, nearly $937 billion, was comprised of hospital care. Other notable expenses included physician and clinical services ($587 billion), prescription drugs ($271 billion), and net cost of health insurance ($174 billion).

                                                    Additionally, healthcare expenditures have historically grown at a rate significantly higher than annual U.S. GDP growth. That’s the reason why healthcare now makes up such a significant portion of overall GDP, and this proportion is expected to keep climbing. What’s interesting, however, is the actual rate of growth has slowed down considerably since 2008 (see below).

                                                          Part of this is explained by the fact that the U.S., and the global economy in general, went through a horrific, debt fueled recession that began in 2007. During the recession, people lost their jobs and insurance coverage and with that, for obvious reasons, healthcare expenditures declined. Six years out from the beginning of the recession and now arguably in an expansion period for the economy, healthcare expenditure growth, surprisingly, has remained muted. This is despite the fact unemployment in the U.S. is 5.6%, based on the latest December jobs report. Looking at this low rate of unemployment and continued GDP growth, you would expect healthcare expenditures to resume their pre-recession annual growth of 5%-7%. Why hasn’t that happened?
                                                        </p>
                                                        
                                                        <p>
                                                          One of the major reasons for this has been the ongoing shift of expenses from the employer or payer to the consumer. Over the last several years, employers have been assuming less of the overall cost for an employee’s healthcare, and in effect have been shifting more of the burden onto the consumer. This has forced consumers to become more cost conscious and therefore less willing to pay for what may be an unnecessary service or product. Additionally, because wage growth has been minimal since the end of the recession, consumers can’t afford to necessarily pay for healthcare costs and as such have been more willing to forego services. An interesting study was published in Health Affairs where the authors came to the conclusion that around 37% of the slowdown seen post the 2007 recession was directly attributable to the recession, while 8% was due to a decline in private insurance and cuts to Medicare. Interestingly, the remaining 55% was due to less innovation, patient cost sharing, and greater provider efficiency (Cutler, Health Aff May 2013 vol. 32 no. 5 841-850). The data below, provided by AHIP (America’s Health Insurance Plans) illustrate the trend perfectly. High deductible plans (i.e. higher cost sharing) grew significantly from March 2005, when roughly 1M total insured lives had one of these plans to January 2013, when over 15M lives had a high-deductible plan.

                                                                In the exchange market, we’re seeing a similar effect, where a majority of enrollees are choosing Silver-level or Bronze-level plans (more on this below). We think this trend is going to continue as employers and other payers shift a greater proportion of costs onto consumers. Additionally, reimbursement cuts to providers add an additional dampening effect to overall expenditures (more below). The key takeaway, however, is overall utilization is likely to remain muted and we’ve probably entered a new normal regarding healthcare expenditure growth and overall utilization.

As you’ll recall, in the spring of 2014, the whole issue came to a head when Representative Henry Waxman (D-California) sent a letter to Gilead asking the company to justify its pricing for its hepatitis C drug, Solvaldi. Solvaldi is priced at $84,000 per patient and with a potential patient population of around 3 million in the United States alone, the drug was raising a significant amount of concern among both private and public payers. States were complaining and asking Congress to intervene as the drug was hitting budgets much harder than had been expected and was likely to continue being an issue. At the same time, employers were watching their prescription costs sky rocket with no end in sight. It turned out that Congress’ attempt to publically humiliate Gilead and get the company to cave on pricing was more of a paper tiger than actual threat, but we think it did bring to the forefront an issue that is likely to remain in focus going forward.
                                                                    </p>

When you look at the state of the U.S. healthcare system, and all the additional people coming on board – what essentially feels like the Titanic – drug pricing has to be a focal point of any attempt at reducing costs. Right now, prescription drugs only make up 10% of the total Medicare budget and based on total healthcare expenditures, only grew 2.5% year-over-year in 2013, but that number doesn’t tell the whole story. First of all, small molecule or non-specialty drugs, which still make up the bulk of total prescriptions, only rose by 2% in 2013 (based on the Express Scripts 2013 Drug Trend Report) as generics launched and former blockbuster medications went generic. The real issue is specialty medications (where Gilead’s Solvaldi fits in), which grew at an annual rate of 14% and over the next several years will account for the majority of total drug spend (Express Scripts 2013 Drug Trend Report). CVS just recently mentioned at their JP Morgan Healthcare Conference presentation that they expect specialty trend to grow 16% in 2015. It’s this class of medications that is going to attract the most scrutiny among payers and providers. At the end of the day, healthcare costs in this country are unsustainable, and to have specialty drugs grow at a rate nearly 4x that of total healthcare expenditures (14% versus 3.8%) is not feasible. We are probably going to look back five years from now and see that Gilead marked the top of unfettered drug pricing in this country.

There’s a small organization here in DC, created through the ACA, called PCORI (the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute). The group is a non- governmental organization that is charged with examining and measuring outcomes of various therapies and devices. Additionally, Medicare may consider the group’s research in determining reimbursement. PCORI recently approved funding to examine Hep C and figure out the best ways to both treat and diagnose the disease. While it’s difficult to know what role PCORI and other organizations may play in pricing and reimbursement over the next several years, when we consider where we are in the debate and the importance of understanding outcomes, we have to imagine there’s going to be a greater push for these sorts of studies in determining what to pay for and what not to.

There’s a middle-ground, and we believe that the days where companies can charge whatever they want will soon be over. Companies are going to have to justify costs and those that have minimal to no competition and are launching products meeting significant unmet medical needs will continue to have some pricing power (some being the operative word), no doubt. But, in markets where there’s competition (like Hep C and the PCSK9s) and/or available generic alternatives, pricing power is going to be limited. The private payers are likely going to be the ones to drive this change (as evidenced by the recent Express Scripts decision to not include Gilead’s Hep C drugs on its formulary) and formulary management will be the stick.

The small molecule or traditional medicine generic wave is nearing an end, but we are about to enter a second, likely more prolonged, wave over the next decade and that is the biogeneric or biosimilar wave. Historically, biotech products have enjoyed ever-lasting life as they’ve been immune to generic competition because of a lack of guidance from the FDA on approvability, a lack of interest on the part of manufacturers to develop a pipeline, and patent protections. We believe all that is changing and we are in the early cycle of a revolution. Over the next several years, hundreds of billions worth of biologic products, and some of the biggest blockbusters in the world, are expected to lose patent protection and will likely face some biosimilar completion. Additionally, the FDA is expected to release additional guidance which should help fuel the revolution.

First and foremost, a biosimilar cannot enter the market until all patents surrounding the innovator product have expired or been successfully challenged. For traditional molecules, this is not so much an issue as the Orange Book lists all available patents and expirations, providing generic challengers with a comprehensive directory of existing patents. That unfortunately is not the case with the Purple Book, the version of the Orange Book for biologic drugs. The Purple Book unfortunately just lists the products and not the patent estate associated with those products, so the responsibility is left to the generic challengers to figure out the patents and when they potentially expire. Additionally, once a challenger gets comfortable with the patents, there is a very long, and drawn out process that ensues.

Biosimilars need to seek approval via the 351(k) approval pathway that was drawn up in the ACA in 2010. The generic challenger must demonstrate similarity to the reference product in terms of safety, efficacy, clinical outcomes, and purity. These are normally demonstrated via PK/PD (pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics) studies in healthy volunteers, pre-clinical assays, and clinical trials, to name a few. Once a challenger feels they’ve been able to satisfy these requirements, they file for approval via the FDA. This filing then triggers a long and drawn out negotiation between the originator and challenger surrounding the patents on the product. Without going into too much detail, the process can last many months and include continuous legal challenges. Resolution, or more clarity around the patents, will likely be needed to streamline the process more. Timing around this is unknown and would require congressional action.
                                                                                                  </p>
                                                                                                  
                                                                                                  <p>
                                                                                                    Another issue of paramount importance is interchangeability and labeling (i.e. naming of a biosimilar product). As of now, the FDA has not provided guidance surrounding studies that need to be done in order to have an interchangeable product. By interchangeable we mean a product that can be substituted at the pharmacy level versus the original product. This substitutability is important regarding uptake of a biosimilar product. The naming of the product – whereby the biosimiar keeps the generic name of the original product – is also an important issue that feeds in directly with interchangeability and substitutability of the product versus the original. The FDA is expected to issue guidance on these issues sometime in 2015.
                                                                                                  </p>
                                                                                                  
                                                                                                  <p>

Currently, many biologic products have multiple indications (i.e. approved for different diseases or conditions) and originator products have multitudes of clinical data that went into supporting approval and uptake within the various indications. The FDA fully understands, however, that for a biosimilar, it’s unthinkable and undoable to face the same clinical constraints as the originator and so the agency is in the process of coming up with a framework to map out extrapolation. So far, based on the recent FDA panel meeting and recommendation for approval of Sandoz’s biosimilar of Amgen’s Neupogen, the FDA appears willing to extrapolate Sandoz’s one clinical trial and demonstration of similar safety and efficacy to the multiple indications that Neupogen is currently approved for. A similar story unfolded in Europe with Celltrion’s biosimilar of Remicade, where the European agency granted approval in all of Remicade’s indications based on one trial. It would be easy to use these two examples to extrapolate to future approvals but that is probably not a wise choice. Neupogen and Remicade are less complex drugs (from a manufacturing and chemical structure perspective) versus other complicated antibodies, so we will need to see additional clarity from the FDA on this front.

Don’t use Europe as a proxy of what biosimilars can do in this country. There’s no doubt uptake in Europe has been slow but we think that is unlikely to be the case here in the United States. The U.S. healthcare system is driven by the private market and judging by what PBMs and distributors are saying – and their profit motive – they expect to drive usage of biosimilars immediately. We expect to see a similar impact across the supply chain (mainly the distributors and PBMs) in profitability that we saw in the earlier generic wave. Manufacturers, both traditionally generic as well as branded biopharmaceutical companies, are likely to see a very nice uptick as well. Interestingly, this is probably a longer-tail event than the earlier wave we experienced, as the six-month exclusivity seen with traditional generics is not likely to be seen with biosimilars.

Right now, infused drugs are reimbursed at ASP (average sales price) plus 6%; in essence the physician or practice gets 6% above what they pay to purchase the drug. Going forward, and based on the language in the ACA, biogenerics are likely to get the same formula, but what’s interesting is that physicians will get reimbursed at 6% of the originator’s ASP price, not the biosimilar. So in essence what this does is remove the reimbursement incentive for a physician or practice to use a branded drug over a biosimilar. We think this is going to be another important driver regarding future uptake of the drugs.

The uninsured rate in Medicaid-expansion states fell during this time period from 15.0% to 10.2%, and even in non-expansion states the uninsured rate fell from 20.5% to 15.1%, largely as a result of the federal exchange (Healthcare.gov) and greater awareness of Medicaid among previously eligible but unenrolled populations. The uninsured rate is expected to continue to fall as more persons eligible for Medicaid or subsidized insurance through an exchange become aware of and gain access to health coverage. The remaining uninsured population largely consists of undocumented persons, who are ineligible for Medicaid and denied access to the exchanges per the ACA, and persons who prefer to pay the punitive fee rather than purchase insurance.

This has largely borne out as Medicaid and CHIP enrollment has increased nationally by 9.7 million persons since October 2013 according to CMS, even though the Supreme Court made Medicaid expansion non- mandatory in its landmark NFIB v Sebelius ruling in 2012. The Kaiser Family Foundation found that Medicaid enrollment increased by 8.3% across all states in state fiscal year (SFY) 2014 and is expected to climb an additional 13.2% in SFY 2015. Enrollment grew in Medicaid-expansion states by 12.2% in SFY 2014 and is expected to grow an additional 18.0% in SFY 2015. In non-expansion states, enrollment grew by just 2.8% in SFY 2014, but it is expected to grow by 5.2% in SFY 2015 due to increased participation among individuals eligible under pre-ACA rules.

During the 2014 plan year open enrollment period, the Department of Health and Human Services indicates that 8.02 million individuals selected a marketplace plan through the exchanges, including 5.45 million through Healthcare.gov and 2.57 million through the 15 state-operated exchanges. In total, 85% of these individuals qualified for and received financial assistance in the form of premium tax credits or cost-sharing assistance. Enrollment for plan year 2015 is expected to be even higher. Preliminary data indicates that 6.59 million individuals have selected a health plan via Healthcare.gov through January 2. Open enrollment runs through February 15.

While this slowdown corresponds with the passage of the ACA, the reasons for the slowdown are varied and debatable, with most observers crediting the overall slowdown in the economy. The ACA generally is credited with being a contributing factor to the slowdown in Medicare spending, which accounts for 20% of NHE. A report published in Health Affairs posits that the payment reductions implemented in fee-for- service (FFS) Medicare and Medicare Advantage (MA) by the ACA likely combined with slower enrollment growth, flat per-enrollee growth as relatively younger Baby Boomers join the program, slower increases in hospital outpatient utilization and a decline in the volume and intensity of physician services to hold Medicare growth to just 3.4% in 2013. Budget sequestration, which requires an annual 2.0% reduction in aggregate Medicare expenditures through 2024, is also thought to play a significant role in the deceleration of NHE.

The industry surprised many by deciding to work cooperatively with the Obama Administration in the development of the legislation, agreeing to accept significantly greater regulation of industry practices and products in return for the potential of millions of new customers via the exchanges. Its gamble has paid off as over 8 million individuals signed up for health insurance through federal and state exchanges in plan year 2014, over 85% of whose premiums are paid for in part by the federal government. Managed care companies have been able to adhere to the ACA’s new requirements for qualified health benefit plans and the prohibition on medical underwriting while maintaining affordability by developing plans with increased beneficiary cost-sharing, especially high-deductible plans, and narrower provider networks.

More than half of all Medicaid enrollees now receive benefits through a comprehensive risk-based managed care organization (MCO) and Medicaid-expansion states rely more heavily upon MCOs to provide care to enrollees than non-expansion states. Medicaid enrollment is projected to continue to grow over the next several years, as is state Medicaid program use of MCOs. The population being added to Medicaid via the ACA expansion (nondisabled adults) is relatively less impoverished and healthier than other Medicaid populations. According to MACPAC data, in 2011 the spending per full-year equivalent adult enrollee is just $4,368 compared to $19,031 for disabled enrollees and $16,236 for elderly enrollees.

During the development of the law, the hospital industry agreed to accept about $155 billion in payment reductions under Medicare in return for a promised influx of newly insured individuals through Medicaid and the exchanges;however, while the hospital industry has performed well since the passage of the ACA, the industry’s gamble has not paid off to the degree expected due to a variety of policy, political, and legal decisions.

Additionally, Congress has passed additional payment reductions through subsequent legislation that further constrains Medicare payments. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) estimates that, on average, hospitals have Medicare margins of -5.4% in 2013. While MedPAC estimates that Medicare margins for for-profits are higher than the industry average (1.2%) and that all-payer margins remain high industry-wide (7.2%), the impact of the ACA payment cuts is demonstrable.

The Supreme Court ruled in NFIB v. Sebelius that Medicaid expansion is optional for the states and 23 states have elected not to expand the program, including 11 states in the South. Consequently, there are about 4 million poor uninsured adults that fall into a “coverage gap”, meaning that they earn too much to be eligible for Medicaid under pre-ACA eligibility rules, but earn too little to qualify for premium tax credits to afford insurance through an exchange. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 86% of the individuals in the coverage gap live in the South, with 25% residing in Texas, 17% in Florida, 9% in North Carolina, and 7% in Georgia.

In the 2014 plan year, 65% of persons selected a Silver plan and 20% selected a Bronze plan, which require the individual to cover 30% and 40% of the plan’s actuarial value, respectively. While persons with a Silver plan may qualify for cost-sharing subsidies if they earn less than 250% of FPL, Bronze plan purchasers do not qualify for any such subsidy. The average deductible for an individual and family Bronze plan enrollee is $5,181 and $10,545, respectively, and coinsurance is generally greater than 30%. Out-of-pocket expenses are capped by the ACA at $6,600 for individual plans and $13,200 for family plans, but these levels are above and beyond what many individuals and families can afford.

Burwell case that will have oral arguments before the Supreme Court on March 4, with a final decision expected in June. The plaintiffs contend that the ACA as written permits qualifying individuals (those with incomes of less than 400% FPL) to receive premium tax credit subsidies only if they purchase insurance on a state-operated exchange. That is, the residents of the 36 states that utilize the federal exchange (Healthcare.gov) would not eligible to receive premium tax subsidies if the plaintiffs prevail.

The law also permits the federal government to establish an exchange for a state at Section 1321 of the Act. The premium tax credit subsidies are established under Section 1401 of the Act, which creates a new Section 36B of the Internal Revenue Code. As written, Section 36B of the IRC permits individuals to receive a premium tax credit subsidy if they purchase insurance through a state-operated exchange established under Section 1311 of the Act; there is no mention of a federally-operated exchange established under Section 1321.
                                                                                                                                                </p>
                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                <p>
                                                                                                                                                  In writing its implementing regulations for Section 36B of the IRC, the Internal Revenue Service defined an eligible individual as one who purchases insurance through either a state-operated exchange established under Section 1311 of the Act or a through a federally- operated exchange established under Section 1321 of the Act. The plaintiffs in the King case contend that the IRS overstepped its bounds in its interpretation of the law and is asking the Court to invalidate the regulation, which would have the impact of denying premium tax credit subsidies to persons residing in states with federally-operated exchanges. The government argues that the language in 36B is not entirely clear, that congressional intent and common sense indicate that the entire paradigm of the ACA requires that all persons are eligible for premium tax credit subsidies regardless of the type of exchange through which they purchase insurance, and that the IRS is within its authority to interpret the statute in the manner chosen.

Those choosing to maintain coverage under this scenario are likely to be sicker, older, and at higher risk for illnesses that are expensive to treat; the result would be the dreaded “death spiral” as insurance premiums would need to increase to fit the new risk profile of the pool, thus causing more individuals to drop coverage, further altering the pool risk, causing premiums to increase further, leading to more individuals to drop coverage, etc.

Conversely, the full impact of a plaintiff victory is likely to felt by hospitals, which suddenly would face on onslaught of newly uninsured patients.

In 2014, about 4.5 million individuals signed up for subsidized health insurance on Healthcare.gov (86% of the 5.5 million enrolled); preliminary numbers show that 2015 enrollment is likely to be higher. CBO estimates that 13 million individuals will purchase insurance through an exchange in 2015; about 9 million will do so through the federal exchange and just less than 8 million are likely to be eligible for premium subsidies.

The Urban Institute estimates that 75% of these persons would elect to drop their coverage. The RAND Corporation estimates that those maintaining their insurance would likely see an additional 47% increase in unsubsidized premiums.

According to HHS data, nearly one-third of all individuals purchasing insurance through the federal exchange in 2014 and 2015 reside in Florida (18%) or Texas (13%). This means that about 1 million Floridians and 750,000 Texans are likely to become uninsured if King prevails.

In the past few months, a private group in Florida has urged lawmakers there to consider expanding Medicaid and the new Governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, apparently has asked his staff to explore the issue.

In neither case have lawmakers indicated a willingness to move forward and approval by the state legislatures is paramount. It is clear that Florida, Texas, and other Republican-led states are interested in following the lead of Iowa, Michigan, and others to use Section 1115 waivers to expand Medicaid using market-based, conservative-leaning strategies such as increased cost- sharing for enrollees, utilization of managed care and private health accounts, and/or job training referrals for newly enrolled individuals in the expansion population. There are several challenges to expanding Medicaid in this manner:

Medicaid law does not permit cost-sharing for persons earning less than 150% FPL, but CMS has granted waivers to states to require cost sharing for individuals as low as 100% (Iowa, Michigan) and even 50% (Arkansas); however, CMS has not granted Indiana’s request for a waiver to require cost-sharing for all enrollees. The Florida plan proposed by a private group closely matches the Indiana plan and Texas seems to be interested in a plan that incorporates significant cost-sharing requirements – while this might appeal to conservative lawmakers, it is unlikely to secure CMS approval.

Both Florida and Texas appear to be interested in implementing a work requirement or job-training requirement. To date, however, the farthest CMS has been willing to go is to permit states to refer Medicaid enrollees to the state’s job training programs, but the receipt of benefits cannot be contingent upon participation in the program. This is a red-line for CMS. Until state governments in Florida and Texas are able to structure a Medicaid expansion plan that can secure approval from state legislators and CMS, Medicaid expansion will have to wait.

Most Republicans now privately admit that full repeal is not a realistic possibility; rather, they will attempt to pass a variety of measures that amend the law:

The issue is a top priority for the medical device industry and overturning the tax has broad bipartisan support. The tax itself has proven difficult to implement and has failed to generate expected revenues. The most significant hurdle to repeal is the cost ($30 billion), which may need to be offset; the President has not yet weighed in on this matter.

Republicans argue that the provision is damaging to small businesses and the bill has the strong support of the Chamber of Commerce. Regardless, it is unlikely that the bill will become law: conservative pundits surprised many congressional Republicans by arguing that the 40-hour work week definition is actually more damaging to workers than the 30-hour work week definition, which undercut one of the bill’s sponsors primary arguments; the CBO scored the bill as costing $53 billion, which likely makes it cost-prohibitive for some fiscal conservatives; and President Obama has forcefully promised a veto. The legislation does not have enough support to override a veto.

Additionally, the provision may be superfluous – as long as the individual mandate remains in effect, the underlying structure of the ACA likely can remain intact even if the employer mandate is jettisoned, particularly since the Administration refused to enforce the employer mandate in 2014 and the law seemed to operate reasonably well. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that the Obama Administration would support this change to the law, particularly after it threatened to veto the 40-hour work week bill.

CMS believes that the risk corridor program will be budget neutral and therefore does not require congressional appropriations. At this time, the program does not seem to be imperiled by the funding prohibition included in the omnibus. Furthermore, the risk corridors expire after plan year 2016 (the last payments will be made in 2017 to reconcile misalignment of pricing), so the issue may be moot. We expect the debate between Congress and the Administration to continue, but it will have little substantive impact on the program or managed care companies.

Burwell</em> is a serious threat to the ACA as it is currently structured.</strong> We believe that it is plausible for the plaintiffs to prevail in a 5-4 ruling that finds the law as written permits the government to provide premium tax credits only to individuals purchasing insurance on a state-operated exchange. The plaintiff’s argument fits within the world-view of the conservative majority on the Court and has prevailed with conservative-leaning judges in lower courts. This outcome would be extremely disruptive to the healthcare market and is particularly threatening to hospitals. The onus would fall on Republicans in state capitals and in Congress to cooperate with the Obama Administration to identify and quickly implement regulatory and legislative fixes that prevent millions of low-income and middle-class Americans from losing their health coverage for an extended period of time. From a practical standpoint, the recourse for state officials is relatively limited; establishing a state-operated exchange is complex and time consuming and all federal resources to assist in this effort have expired. The Court is expected to rule in June; we believe it would be very difficult for a state to establish a state-operated exchange in less than 12 months from that time. Conversely, Congress could quickly and easily fix the issue with a one-page technical amendment, but Republicans are unlikely to acquiesce and probably will demand holistic change to the law. The political pressure on Republicans to act and to do so quickly will most certainly intensify, though, particularly with the 2016 election around the corner and the White House and control of the Senate up for grabs. Florida is the state most impacted by a ruling in favor of King and also the most populous swing state. Consequently, the president and Democrats likely have more leverage under this scenario than one might think to force a compromise in the latter half of 2015 that would alter the law, perhaps dramatically, but restore insurance coverage to impacted individuals and families.

His forceful veto threat of the 40-hour work-week bill indicates that he is very comfortable challenging Republicans over the ACA. Thus, the earliest that Republicans could make substantive changes to the law would be January 2017 if they win the White House and maintain control of the Senate and the House. In general, we expect the underlying tenants of the law to remain intact in the long-term in this scenario; by early 2017, the law will have been in place for nearly seven years and the fourth open enrollment period will be near completion. It is extremely difficult to dramatically alter an ingrained benefit. Furthermore, beginning in 2017, states can seek Section 1332 waivers under the law to completely restructure their healthcare systems with few federal strings attached – there is less incentive to dramatically restructure the ACA if states can essentially “re-write” the law through a waiver.

The early struggles of Healthcare.gov appear to have been addressed and there have been few recent reports of any difficulties at the state or federal level.

The deal offered by the federal government is simply too good for states to ignore. Additionally, there is increasing pressure from providers and employers for states to act, which makes continued intransigence on this issue politically unsustainable for conservative lawmakers over the long-term. CMS has proven that it is willing to work with Republican-led states to approve Section 1115 waivers that expand Medicaid using conservative philosophies of cost-sharing, private accounts, managed care, job training referrals, etc. The process will be drawn out in certain states (e.g., Texas and Florida), but eventually the states will expand coverage through a Section 1115 waiver or a more comprehensive combined 1115 / 1332 waiver.

High-deductible plans are the most expedient way for managed care companies to structure and market affordable plans in a manner compliant with the ACA. The increasing prevalence of high-deductible plans could present significant challenges to providers tasked with collecting fees from their patients. Congress may have to implement new policies to address this matter, such as expanding government cost-sharing subsidies or facilitating greater adoption of health savings accounts or other means of utilizing the tax code to permit tax-preferential savings for beneficiaries to meet cost-sharing obligations.
