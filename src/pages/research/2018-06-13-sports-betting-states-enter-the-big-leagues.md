The Takeaway: 

The U.S. Supreme Court officially fired the starting gun yesterday on legal sports wagering nationwide. Each state needs to approve legislation to regulate the activity within its borders. So far, there are seven states in which sports betting regulations are likely to be in place by the time the NFL season begins in August. Some of these seven states require additional legislation to expand upon limited regulatory regimes previously approved. Others require nothing but implementation now that SCOTUS fully repealed the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA). We think it is still likely that one or two states will approve legislation by the end of June to either expand previously restrictive sports gaming regulations or pass entirely new regimes within their borders. We think another one or two states will pass legislation by the end of 2018. We do not think Congress will pass any laws at the federal level any time soon to usurp what is happening at the state level. See our April 18 and April 4 reports for additional background and details.
