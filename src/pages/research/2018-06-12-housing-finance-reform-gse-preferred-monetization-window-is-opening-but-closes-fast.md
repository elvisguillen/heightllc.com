The Takeaway:

Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) Director Mel Watt's comment that FHFA will propose GSE risk-based capital (RBC) standards "in the very near future" is positive for GSE investors. We know Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin wants to restructure the GSEs because he views the current conservatorship status as unsustainable. An RBC framework
would clearly quantify the amount of capital that Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC) would need to be designated "well-capitalized" and able to exit conservatorship. We assess the potential capital needed to be designated "well-capitalized" and assess potential returns based on several scenarios, including a restructuring of the GSEs that includes Treasury exiting its almost $200 billion position in the GSEs (FNMA - $123.7
billion, FMCC - $72.6 billion).
