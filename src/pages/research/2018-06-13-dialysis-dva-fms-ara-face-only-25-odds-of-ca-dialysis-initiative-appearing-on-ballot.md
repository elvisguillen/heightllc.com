The Takeaway: 

We view it as inevitable that the California Fair Pricing for Dialysis Act will qualify for the statewide ballot by June 1, but we believe it is only 25% likely the initiative will
actually appear on the ballot in November. We believe the more likely outcome is that Governor Jerry Brown will sign legislation to regulate dialysis facility staffing levels and
third-party premium payments. Relative to the threat of the ballot initiative, this legislative compromise would be a positive outcome for dialysis providers DaVita (DVA), Fresenius
(FMS), and American Renal Associates (ARA).
