The Takeaway: 

Despite the best efforts of former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Director Richard Cordray to eliminate the payday lending industry, the business is not only alive and kicking but it is getting newfound support from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), and CFPB Acting Director Mick Mulvaney. The regulators are taking actions that are positive for the payday and auto title lending industries as Congress' effort to overturn the CFPB's payday lending rule lacks sufficient Senate Republican support. (See our May 8 report for additional detail.) The CFPB is expected to publish its revised payday lending rule in February 2019. Payday lenders, including Enova (ENVA) and FirstCash (FCFS), will benefit from a revised or new
payday rule. It is possible, but not our probable outcome, that CFPB will rescind the payday lending rule in its entirety.
