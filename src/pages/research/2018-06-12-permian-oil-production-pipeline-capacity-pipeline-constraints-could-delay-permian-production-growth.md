The Takeaway: 

Oil producers in West Texas are experiencing some growing pains as production threatens to outpace takeaway capacity for both oil and associated gas. These issues are only becoming more acute since we last discussed takeaway constraints and limits on
gas flaring in early April. Now, gas pipeline capacity reportedly is 98% full and the Midland oil price is heavily discounted to WTI, implying a high transportation cost for additional barrels out of the Permian basin. Eventually, the pipelines will come – especially for crude oil – but for now we believe producers will consider delaying new well completion out or regard for limited pipeline capacity and the worry that limits to natural gas flaring could create significant operational disruptions for wells. Uncertainty around flaring rules is a meaningful headwind in both Texas and New Mexico, where methane venting and flaring traditionally went unregulated but would be subject to federal regulation in many areas.
