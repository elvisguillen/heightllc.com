               The Republican Party has emerged with decisive gains from yesterday’s mid-term elections, netting at least seven seats in the U.S. Senate and more than a dozen in the U.S. House of Representatives. Republicans picked up expected seats in Montana, South Dakota, and West Virginia, and also took harder-to-get seats from incumbent Democrats in Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, and North Carolina. The only true toss-up race that Democrats have thus far managed to defend was in New Hampshire, where Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D) bested former Sen. Scott Brown’s (R) efforts to capture her seat. Sen. Mark Warner (D) also appears poised to successfully defend his seat in Virginia, though his opponent has not yet conceded. Based on currently known results, Republicans are expected to control at least 53 and as many as 55 seats in the U.S. Senate as of January 2015. As we await final results of the as-yet-undecided Senate races (see below), investors are contemplating how a larger-than-expected Republican majority could affect prospects for various energy-related legislative and regulatory priorities. Below, we reiterate our outlook for various energy issues possibly affected by the outcome of the mid-term elections. On the final page of this report, we offer a brief analysis of the number of likely Senate votes in favor of the long-stalled Keystone XL pipeline project.

              <strong>Three Senate Races Still Undecided:</strong> Alaska, Louisiana, Virginia. As of this writing, final results have not yet been declared in Alaska and Virginia. In both cases, incumbents are Democrats, so Republican victories would add to a Republican majority that already controls 52 seats. Additionally, due to Louisiana election laws, a widely expected run-off between Sen. Mary Landrieu (D) and Rep. Bill Cassidy (R) will take place on December 6 (see below). In Alaska, former Bush administration official Dan Sullivan (R) leads Sen. Mark Begich (D) by more than 8,000 votes (nearly 4 percent), but Sen. Begich has not yet conceded. In Virginia, despite pre-election polling data suggesting Sen. Mark Warner (D) enjoyed a substantial lead against former Republican National Committee (RNC) Chairman Ed Gillespie (R), Sen. Warner has a 12,000-vote advantage, which equates to a margin of just 0.5 percent. Like Sen. Begich, Mr. Gillespie has not yet conceded. Sen. Warner has several pro-fossil fuel stances, including supporting the Keystone XL pipeline and wanting to expand offshore drilling in the Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf.

              <strong>Louisiana: Landrieu Garners 42 Percent of Vote, Faces December 6 Run-Off Against Cassidy.</strong> As expected, due to Louisiana election laws, Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chair Mary Landrieu (D-LA) will be forced to enter a run-off contest against Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) on December 6. In Louisiana, a candidate must garner at least 50 percent of votes in order to claim victory on election night. Although Sen. Landrieu managed to edge Rep. Cassidy by 16,000 votes (42.1 percent of total votes, a 1 percent margin), Rep. Cassidy split votes with fellow Republican candidate Rob Maness. Rep. Cassidy got 41 percent of votes; Maness was the third-highest vote- getter with 13.8 percent of the tally. Given outcomes across the country and an already-known Republican majority for 2015, Sen. Landrieu’s December 6 run-off against Rep. Cassidy will not itself determine the Senate majority as some had thought it might. On the one hand, this could mean that national Republican interests might be inclined to spend less to ensure Rep. Cassidy wins, thus benefiting Sen. Landrieu’s prospects of retaining her narrow lead (although some major Republican PACs have, in recent hours, committed substantial dollars to Rep. Cassidy’s run- off efforts). On the other hand, if one assumes that many Maness-backers will now be inclined to support Rep. Cassidy in a two-way run-off, it seems Rep. Cassidy could enjoy a substantial lead over the incumbent Sen. Landrieu. The main question remains whether the oil and gas industry will actively support Sen. Landrieu in the coming weeks, now that it is known she will no longer serve as Committee Chair.

              <strong>Colorado: Garner Tops Udall by 5 Points; Gubernatorial Race Still Undecided; Fracking, LNG in Focus.</strong> Rep. Cory Gardner (R) managed a decisive victory against incumbent Sen. Mark Udall (D), delivering a key Senate pick- up for Republicans. Rep. Gardner is a vocal proponent of Keystone XL and the wind power industry (he supports an extension of the wind production tax credit); he is also the lead sponsor of legislation (H.R. 6) to expedite the approval of liquefied natural gas (LNG) export projects. As we have written previously, however, we think relevant agencies (DOE, FERC, MARAD, etc.) have sufficient authorities to carry out the Obama administration’s LNG export regulatory initiative. That said, even with sufficient authority and DOE’s propensity not to delay non-FTA decisions after FERC issues its own authorization (see Cameron LNG, which received FERC approval on June 19 and DOE non- FTA authorization on September 10), we believe a Republican-controlled Senate could move to impose a more specific deadline on DOE to act on non-FTA applications, especially now that the Energy Information Administration (EIA) has delivered its updated scenario analysis (12, 16, 20 Bcf/d) showing economic gains outweigh “modest” natural gas price increases associated with higher cumulative exports. Colorado is also home to a significant and as-yet-undecided gubernatorial race. Incumbent John Hickenlooper (D) is just slightly ahead of opponent Bob Beauprez (R). Meanwhile, unsurprisingly, Rep. Jared Polis (D) garnered 55 percent of the vote in his reliably Democratic second district that includes Boulder and other Front Range communities. Rep. Polis had coordinated a series of anti-industry ballot measures that Gov. Hickenlooper and Sen. Udall ultimately managed to set aside in early August. In lieu of the ballot initiatives, which could have imposed increased statewide setback requirements to 2,000 feet and established an “environmental bill of rights” to grant local governments authority to regulate oil and gas operations, Gov. Hickenlooper formed a task force in September to address land-use and other relevant issues. Recommendations from the Colorado task force are due to be issued as soon as March 2015. Regardless of the outcome, we believe environmental groups could contemplate their next opportunity to resurrect oil and gas- related ballot initiatives in the context of the November 2016 election, as Colorado law prohibits statewide ballot measures in odd years unless they relate to taxes or revenues. In California, Ohio, and Texas, municipal-level restrictions of hydraulic fracturing enjoyed mixed results last night. The City of Denton (TX) and City of Athens (OH) voted to ban fracking, while Gates Mills, Kent, and Youngstown (OH), as well as Santa Barbara County (CA), handily defeated efforts to restrict fracking. In Pennsylvania, Tom Wolf (D) handily defeated incumbent Gov. Tom Corbett (R); Wolf has advocated for a 5 percent severance tax on oil and gas extraction, but – like former Gov. Ed Rendell (D), could face difficulty clearing the proposal through a Republican-controlled state legislature.

                    <strong>Iowa:</strong> Ernst Beats Braley by 8.5 Points; Biofuels Remain a Focus, RFS Re-Write More Likely Next Year. In the race to succeed retiring Sen. Tom Harkin (D), Joni Ernst (R) achieved a major victory over Bruce Braley (D). Polls in the weeks leading up to yesterday’s election had shown the candidates in a dead-heat. While naturally an advocate of Iowa’s significant biofuels industry, Ernst is likely to call for a streamlining of subsidies and mandates as part of broader efforts to overhaul the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). Established via legislation in 2007, the RFS has become a fairly antiquated statutory framework as structural gasoline demand declines (and fuel economy improvements) take hold and the gasoline pool is unable to accommodate the volumes originally envisioned in the 2007 law. Investors continue to await a final rule setting 2014 biofuel blending requirements (RVOs) under the RFS. As we have written previously, persistent uncertainty associated with EPA’s annual percentage-setting exercise, not to mention fuel compatibility, misfueling liability, and other concerns associated with the 10 percent “blend wall,” may ultimately force Congress to revisit the RFS as soon as next year, especially now that Republicans will control both chambers of Congress. House Republicans held a series of hearings and issued several “white papers” on the RFS in 2013, and have been highly critical of EPA’s autonomy in setting – albeit very late – annual blending requirements that are inconsistent with statutory policies. A legislative fix is likely to be entertained before EPA must, once again, finalize blending requirements for future years.

                    <strong>Committee Leadership: Murkowski, Inhofe, Upton, Whitfield to Steer Republican Energy Agenda.</strong> Perhaps the most important ramification of a Republican majority is the party’s opportunity to control legislative agendas in committees and on the floor of each chamber. Republican leaders are already laying the groundwork for legislative action in 2015; investors should watch for early signs of priorities emerging as soon as December 2014. Among the more prescient factors could be the extent to which Republicans opt to utilize processes that require lower thresholds for passage, including reconciliation instructions and other mechanisms possibly available to leadership. Investors will recall, for example, that outgoing Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) employed the “nuclear option” in late 2013 to ensure confirmation of various presidential appointees, including federal judges.

                      <strong>Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee: Oil & Gas Exports, Keystone XL.</strong> While Sen. Landrieu’s fate is decided in the coming weeks, one thing about the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee is clear: a Republican will chair it, and that Republican is likely to be Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK). If Sen. Landrieu loses, the top Democratic post would likely go to Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA), the panel’s # 4 Democrat at the moment who – in the past – has advocated for formal investigations of the oil and gas industry and so-called non-commercial speculators for price gouging and market manipulation. Also a member of the Senate Finance Committee, Sen. Cantwell has called for the elimination of oil and gas “company tax preferences,” and supported the extension of wind, biodiesel, and other tax credits. The Energy Committee’s # 2 Democrat, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), will likely keep his post as top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, and # 3 Democrat Tim Johnson (D-SD) is retiring at the end of the year. The Energy Committee has broad jurisdiction, and is likely to be the primary venue in which oil and gas exports, Keystone XL, and others are adjudicated.

                    <li>
                      <strong>Senate Environment and Public Works Committee: EPA Rules, Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS).</strong> Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-OK) is likely to return to the EPW Committee’s top post, as current Ranking Member David Vitter (R-LA) steps aside and focuses on gubernatorial campaign in 2015. The EPW Committee has various EPA- related issues in its jurisdiction, including the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) that, in our view, could attract substantial attention – and possible revision – in 2015. Additionally, EPA’s utilities-facing carbon emissions regulatory initiative comprises one of the Obama administration’s highest priorities, but also a major target of Republicans in Congress. It is a key component of the President’s Climate Action Plan, which was first unveiled in June 2013. EPA’s proposed rule governing emissions from new power plants was released in September 2013; a separate proposal governing emissions from existing, modified, and reconstructed plants was issued on June 2, 2014. More recently, on October 29, EPA issued a notice of data availability (NODA) as a supplement to the June 2014 proposed rule, identifying several areas in which it seeks stakeholder and general public comment (by December 1, 2014). EPA plans to publish a final iteration of the rulemaking in June 2015. Before then, a Republican-controlled Senate – and especially an EPW Committee chaired by Sen. Inhofe – could attempt to advance legislative curbs to EPA authorities in this area, but is very likely to fall short of the 67 votes needed to override a (likely) veto threat. In the more immediate term, Committee members are likely to focus on a U.S. Supreme Court decision – as soon as next Friday, November 14 – regarding whether to consider a case challenging EPA’s Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS), otherwise to take effect in April 2015. For additional details, please refer to our October 29 report on coal- and utilities-related regulatory issues.

                      <strong>Senate Finance Committee: Tax Issues.</strong> Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) may remain the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, although Sen. Charles Grassley (R-IA) could opt to shift from his post atop the Senate Judiciary Committee to reclaim the position currently occupied by Sen. Hatch (Sen. Grassley, like Sen. Cantwell, is a known proponent of wind and biodiesel). The Senate Finance Committee has broad-reaching jurisdiction over such issues as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. It also serves as the lead tax-writing entity of the U.S. Senate, responsible for tax credits and various other benefits, including so-called oil and gas company tax preferences (e.g. intangible drilling cost expensing, percentage depletion, etc.). Investors should expect Committee leaders to be actively engaged in the formulation of comprehensive tax reform, for example. Sooner, the Committee will be tasked with advancing a tax extenders package containing dozens of expired provisions, including the $1.00/gal biodiesel credit and the costly wind production tax credit (PTC).

                      <strong>House Energy & Commerce Committee: Oil and Gas Exports, RFS, EPA Rules, Others.</strong> Committee Chairman Fred Upton (R-MI) staved off an emerging threat from Democrat Paul Clements and escaped with a fairly significant margin of victory. Chairman Upton, along with senior Committee Republicans Joe Barton (R- TX), Ed Whitfield (R-KY), and John Shimkus (R-IL), has coordinated a very strategic and deliberate legislative agenda focused on oil and gas exports, rewriting the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), and dismantling EPA’s utilities-facing carbon emissions regulatory initiative. Energy investors should expect much of the relevant House Committee-level activity to occur under the watch of Chairman Upton and key subcommittee chairmen.

                      <strong>House Ways & Means Committee: Tax Issues.</strong> The Ways & Means Committee is the Senate Finance Committee’s counterpart in the lower chamber. Rep. Dave Camp (R-MI), who formulated a comprehensive tax reform proposal on behalf of Republicans in February 2014, did not run for re-election, and will retire at year- end. Importantly, Reps. Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Kevin Brady (R-TX) plan to run against each other for the opportunity to sit at helm of the powerful Committee.

                    <strong>Other Potential Areas of Interest.</strong> In addition to above-mentioned areas that are at least loosely tied to outcomes of specific races, we note that action on crude oil exports and other issues could more likely materialize as a result of yesterday’s mid-term elections. Below, we highlight several areas not addressed in the above commentary. On the final page of the report, we assess prospects for a bill to force approval of the long-stalled Keystone XL pipeline.

                    <strong>Crude Oil Exports: GOP Control Means More Focus, Sooner; Modification More Likely Than Overhaul.</strong> As we have written previously, though specific outcomes remain highly uncertain, a Republican-controlled Senate brings about the great potential for energy-related legislative action on crude oil exports. This is particularly true because Sen. Murkowski, a known proponent of modifying longstanding crude oil export restrictions, intends to become Chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Perhaps the upper chamber’s most outspoken advocate for loosening export restrictions on crude oil and condensates, Sen. Murkowski has authored several white papers throughout 2014 that have highlighted the Obama administration’s policy options under existing authorities. The Obama administration does not appear poised to take meaningful action in the near term, even now that the mid-term elections are behind us; the White House seems to be in information-gathering mode. For example, last week, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) published the first of at least three relevant reports that we think will inform Washington’s ongoing deliberations regarding crude oil exports. The October 30 deliverable addresses the relationship between Brent crude oil and domestic gasoline prices, finding (unsurprisingly) that “Brent crude oil prices are more important than West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices as a determinant of U.S. gasoline prices in all four [Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts, or PADDs, of the United States] studied, including the Midwest &#8230; The effect that a relaxation of current limitations on U.S. crude oil exports would have on U.S. gasoline prices would likely depend on its effect on international crude oil prices, such as Brent, rather than its effect on domestic crude oil prices.” Still-forthcoming EIA reports will assess the costs associated with various processing technologies (and the amount of time it takes to deploy them into the field), and offer a 10-year production forecast, on a basin-by-basin basis (and by crude type), likely designed to help policymakers understand the nature of expected oil production growth. As we have written recently, we do not think precipitous oil price declines necessarily negate the merits of the crude exports debate (Brent-WTI spreads are perhaps more relevant than absolute price drops). We continue to believe a modification is more likely than a wholesale overhaul of export restrictions, and think the soonest window for action may be mid-2015. For additional details, please refer to our August 19, September 17, September 23, October 15, and October 30 reports.

                          <strong>Iran Sanctions: Republican Majority Could Bring Significant Challenges to Obama’s Negotiating Latitude.</strong> In December 2013, just after the P5+1 issued its Joint Plan of Action, several lawmakers introduced legislation that would limit the President’s ability to prolong diplomatic negotiations for an extended period. Specifically, Sens. Robert Menendez (D-NJ) and Mark Kirk (R-IL) introduced the Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act (S. 1881), which would give the President six months (from enactment) to “facilitate a diplomatic solution” before imposing a series of expanded sanctions designed to further constrain Iranian oil exports, financial activities, and general access to goods, services, and technologies. In order to forestall sanctions imposed by the bill, however, Iran would have to meet a series of difficult-to-achieve conditions included in Section 301 (p. 35-50) of the bill. 59 Senators (43 Republicans and 16 Democrats) are identified as co-sponsors; Sens. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Rand Paul (R-KY) are the only two Republicans that have not sponsored the legislation. House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) has also questioned the P5+1’s ability to strike a final deal that “affirms Iran does not have a right to enrich and permanently and irreversibly dismantles the infrastructure of [Iran’s] uranium and plutonium nuclear programs.” However, ten Senate committee chairs (all Democrats) have insisted that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) not allow a vote no sanctions legislation unless and until the P5+1 fails to yield favorable results, and – at least for the balance of this year, while Sen. Reid remains Majority Leader – Democrats will likely succeed in preventing the bill from receiving a floor vote. However, as of January 2015, we think a sufficient number of lawmakers could advance the legislation, dealing a blow to the Obama administration’s ability to continue negotiating with Iran over the nature and scope of its nuclear program (as a member of the P5+1). At the very least, last night’s election outcomes put substantial pressure on the Obama administration to negotiate diligently ahead of the self-imposed November 24 deadline, as its window for a deal could begin to close as soon as Republicans take control of the Congress in 2015. A recent statement by Iran’s Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution (IRGC) cast a cloud over ongoing P5+1 negotiations. We have written previously of possible energy sector ramifications associated with negotiators’ managing to strike an as-yet-elusive agreement. For details, please refer to our September 23 report.

                          <strong>Acknowledging New Realities, Must the Obama Administration Now Scale Back?</strong> Last night’s election outcomes dealt a major blow to an administration struggling with low approval ratings. President Obama is due to hold a press conference at the White House this afternoon, likely to address Democratic losses in the mid-term elections. In the past 24 hours, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest has been forced to concede that there are “too many Republicans in Congress who even deny the basic scientific fact that climate change is occurring [for the Obama administration to complete all of its work on utilities-facing rules] &#8230; The President will use his executive action to take some additional steps, but he’s also going to continue to talk about this issue in a way that lays the groundwork for action by future Presidents and future Congresses.” These comments support our view that, while the Obama administration is likely to finalize its utilities-facing carbon rules next year, state implementation plans (SIPs) and other mechanisms necessary to enforce emissions limits will likely lag the end of the Obama presidency. Earnest has also acknowledged that the White House is “monitoring the global oil supply and its impact on demand.” A recently unveiled Government Accountability Office (GAO) report – requested by Sen. Murkowski – suggests that lifting export restrictions could raise U.S. crude oil prices by $2-8/bbl. In turn, GAO found that “U.S. prices for gasoline, diesel, and other consumer fuels follow international prices, so allowing crude oil exports would increase world supplies of crude oil, which is expected to reduce international prices and, subsequently, lower consumer fuel prices.” Importantly, the report also encouraged the Energy Department to reexamine the ideal size and location(s) of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), a sentiment echoed by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D-OR) in a letter to Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz in the days thereafter. Sen. Wyden said that, given the amount of time that has elapsed since certain U.S. policies governing oil and gas were put in place (e.g. 1970s- era export restrictions), a “revision” or “updating” may be warranted. Based on last night’s outcomes and the fact the neither the Congress nor the White House would benefit – even politically – from advancing divisive, one-sided energy policies, we believe the White House will have to find ways to engage Republican lawmakers on issues it has tended to avoid, or at least keep entirely separate from, legislative involvement since Obama took office in 2009.

                                <strong>Keystone XL: Doing the Math &#8230; GOP Majority Benefits 2015 Vote, But Veto-Proof Majority Still Out of Reach?</strong> Shares of TransCanada (TRP) and Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ), among others, have responded favorably to news that Republicans will control both chambers of the U.S. Congress next year. In general, investors believe that prospects for the long-stalled Keystone XL pipeline project de facto improve with Republican gains. While we agree that Republicans tend to be more supportive of the project, and options to circumvent the Presidential Permit process to force approval of the project, we encourage a bit of caution in assessing the legislative landscape. In June, Sens. Mary Landrieu (D-LA) and John Hoeven (R-ND) successfully advanced their Keystone XL Pipeline Approval Act (LINK) through the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee by a 12-10 vote; however, the bill stalled on the Senate floor as Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) refused to grant the legislation a formal vote. As we have written previously, we believe the bill starts with 56 “yes” votes, comprised of all 45 Senate Republicans in the 113th Congress, plus 11 Senate Democrats who signed an April 10 letter to President Obama urging swift approval of the project (even as the “private property savings clause” in Section 1(e) yields to ongoing land-use considerations under review by the Nebraska Supreme Court; a decision in that case is expected as soon as 1Q2015). The Landrieu- Hoeven bill would circumvent the Presidential Permit process stipulated by Bush-era Executive Order 13337 (April 2004) and force approval of the project. As we have written previously, a Republican-controlled Senate would very likely yield the 60 votes needed to pass legislation in the upper chamber, but may still fall short of the 67 necessary to override a veto threat from President Obama. Based on our analysis of election results, it is nearly guaranteed that the Senate will garner 60 “yes” votes, but 67 still appears to be somewhat out of reach. This is due to the fact that only four (4) Senate seats Republicans picked up as a result of yesterday’s mid-term elections were previously held by Democrats who would have voted against a Keystone XL bill; the rest were previously occupied by pro- Keystone Democrats, so those pick-ups do not deliver incremental votes for the Landrieu-Hoeven bill. The Obama administration may yet decide to accept the “will of the Senate” if presented with a bill to force approval, or could – conversely – decide to preempt any Congressional attempts to force approval with an action in either direction. As an aside, longtime Keystone XL proponent Rep. Lee Terry (R-NE) appears likely to lose his seat to Brad Ashford (D). As of this writing, with 85 percent of precincts reporting, Rep. Terry was 4,000 votes (2.5 percent) behind Ashford. Rep. Terry’s re-election prospects became challenged when his opponent began highlighting comments the Congressman made last year suggesting he would not forfeit his paycheck during the government shutdown.
