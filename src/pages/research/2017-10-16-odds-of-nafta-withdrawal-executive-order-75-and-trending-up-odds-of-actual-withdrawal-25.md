The Takeaway:

_We think investors underappreciate the likelihood that President Trump issues an executive order (EO) triggering a U.S. withdrawal from NAFTA. We put odds of this event at 75%, most likely at some point in the mid-November / early-December time frame. This view is driven significantly by events of late last week that saw Trump take dramatic steps to unwind prior Administration’s policies – even against the advice and wishes of others in the Republican Party.<u> However, triggering NAFTA withdrawal and actual withdrawal are currently viewed as unified events and must be decoupled</u>. We put prospects for actual withdrawal as still possible but lower, at only 25%. Reasons preventing actual withdrawal are aggressive lobbying by prominent Republican-aligned advocacy groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and agricultural communities, combined with the popularity of NAFTA in Mexico and Canada – all of which will likely pressure negotiators from the three countries to ultimately reach some sort of modest alteration rather than dissolve the trade pact entirely._
