The Takeaway:

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) continues to send signals that reinforce our view that the agency intends to pursue a number of regulatory actions in specific order over
the months and years ahead that will partially mitigate for major tobacco manufacturers the most burdensome of regulatory headwinds (e.g., rules that require cigarettes contain
minimally or non-addictive levels of nicotine) via a series of regulatory actions that create tailwinds for these companies (e.g., approvals to sell new next generation tobacco
products in the U.S., approvals to market those products as relatively less harmful than cigarettes, etc.). Today's report highlights our takeaways from a tobacco regulatory policy
conference in Washington earlier this week, and previews a second conference slated to begin later today.
