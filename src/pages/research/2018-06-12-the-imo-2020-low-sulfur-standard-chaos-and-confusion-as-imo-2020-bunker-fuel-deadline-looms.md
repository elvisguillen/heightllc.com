The Takeaway: 

Marine fuel, at roughly 4 million bbl/d, is a small share of the global fuel market, yet it may play a temporarily outsized role in energy markets as the shipping industry braces
for the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) 2020 low sulfur fuel standard. The standard requires bunker fuels to contain 0.5% sulfur or less by January 1, 2020, down from 3.5% today (though actual bunker fuel sulfur content is lower, around 2.7%). Refiners are on the hook to manufacture the new compliant fuels, or at least manufacture enough existing compliant fuels to meet demand. Due to significant uncertainty about product specifications and the feasibility of reducing sulfur content in fuels to the required level, we believe most shippers will replace heavy fuel oil (HFO) bunker products with middle distillates, like Marine Gasoil (MGO)—pulling between 1-2 mmbbl/d of incremental distillate demand into the bunker fuel market. Residual products will struggle to find a home, most likely oil-dependent power demand, and they will need a steep discount to be competitive with competitor fuels like coal. The market—along with many shippers—is just beginning to brace for the changes, which the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) warns will cause “chaos and confusion” when the standards take effect in 18 months.
