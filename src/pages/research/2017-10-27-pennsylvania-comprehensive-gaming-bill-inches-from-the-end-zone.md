The Takeaway:

Both chambers of the Pennsylvania General Assembly have now approved a comprehensive gaming package. To become law, the legislation still needs the signature of Governor Tom Wolf (D), which we think is likely over the next few days. Due to several new revenue opportunities and included protections for existing establishments proposed in the legislation, casinos in Pennsylvania have the chance to make net gains despite facing increased fees and a greater number of entities that will be allowed to offer gaming. We think concerns over the past 24 hours voiced most loudly by **PENN** are a result of the opportunity cost this legislation represents relative to prior versions of the bill (it does not allow for a massive influx of video gaming terminals that PENN could have monopolized). In fact, we expect PENN to benefit from internet gaming legalization and the opportunity to open a satellite casino and run VGTs in truck stops across the state. Other PA land-based casino owners include **LVS**, **CZR**, **PNK**, and **ERI**. Internet gaming operators and vendors weâ€™re watching include **TSGI:CN**, **888:LN**, and **GAN:LN**.
