The Takeaway:

_On Friday, Energy Secretary Rick Perry sent heads spinning when his agency [<u>initiated a proceeding</u>](file:///C:/Users/ocostello/Downloads/20170929-5055(32427142).pdf) with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that appears designed to bail out struggling coal and nuclear plants in competitive markets. The question on everyone’s mind is whether this request could lead FERC to essentially re-regulate a class of power plants &#8211; an extreme action which would be unprecedented since the creation of the competitive markets in the 1990s. We think not; FERC has exclusive jurisdiction to establish tariffs in wholesale markets, and DOE can’t shove market reforms down FERC’s throat. However, the various stakeholders (DOE, FERC, many power markets) do have something in common – they all believe that the power markets do a poor job valuing inflexible units at times and that this overwhelmingly disadvantages coal and nuclear. FERC, along with independent system operators like ISO-NE, NYISO, PJM, and others, have been working to understand this problem and think about solutions for much of the year. Our take is that Perry might not get what he wants out of the DOE request, but the power markets might just get what they need._
