The Takeaway: 

President Trump's surprise announcement that the White House will "in two weeks" host
pharmaceutical executives "to announce voluntary massive drops in prices" is consistent
with his Administration's "bully pulpit" strategy of cajoling the drug makers into industryled
changes to drug pricing. The announcement gives drug makers a choice between
doing drug pricing the "easy way" or the "hard way." In the coming weeks, they can quickly
identify drug pricing decreases worthy of the President's praise or face the threat of being
in the President's crosshairs, eliciting more public outrage and escalating the likelihood
of more severe regulation.
