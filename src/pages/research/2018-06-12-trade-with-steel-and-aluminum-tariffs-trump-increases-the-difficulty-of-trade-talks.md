The Takeaway: 

We believe that President Trump's decision to apply steel and aluminum tariffs to the EU, Mexico, and Canada - in the midst of larger trade talks with all three parties - will delay progress on future negotiations, even as Commerce Secretary Ross highlighted the administration's desire to continue negotiating. There is a counter argument that the administration's actions are simply the maximal application of Trump's brinksmanship style of negotiating, but this appears at odds with statements from Canadian PM Trudeau and the Mexican delegation. Absent some significant US concessions in the coming week, NAFTA approval appears likely to be pushed into 2019 as we approach the latest possible date a deal may come together and still receive a Congressional vote in 2018. Domestically, trade is rapidly becoming a point of contention between Trump and other Republicans, setting the table for increased intraparty conflict heading into midterm elections. This is exacerbated by increasingly contentious disagreements among Trump's advisors about how best to approach trade policy, which in turn have spilled into public view and highlighted the lack of a cohesive approach within the White House. This lack of cohesion gives rise to an increasing level of unpredictability. Almost any outcome now seems feasible, and prediction is hampered by the understanding that policy is driven now more than ever by the minute-to-minute decisions of President Trump.
