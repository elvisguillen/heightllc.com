        <em><strong>The Takeaway:</strong></em>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The outcome of next week’s FOMC meeting remains opaque.  That said, the hawks have some ammunition.  While not all of the hawks’ arguments are particularly convincing, the most cogent among them – that the labor market data suggest the time has come to begin normalization – was bolstered this week by the July JOLTS report which showed that the gap between job openings and hires continued to widen.  It may or may not be next week, but I believe that at some point during the remainder of the year the FOMC will conclude that at least some semblance of the Phillips curve still applies and that the time has come to start raising rates.

                <strong>Preface</strong>
              </p>
              
              <p>
                I don’t know whether or not the FOMC will raise rates at the Committee’s meeting next week, and I suspect that at this point in time the FOMC doesn’t know either.  After a long stint in the “Fed raises in September” camp, I “decamped” (opining that the most likely outcome of the September 16-17 FOMC meeting was no rate hike) on August 27 after New York Fed President William Dudley’s remarks on August 26 that, “…the decision to begin the normalization process at the September FOMC meeting seems less compelling…”  I now think a rate hike next week is a toss-up; a 50-50 proposition.  That having been said, for purposes of holding me accountable for being either “right” or “wrong”, I’ll stick with my August 27 call of no hike next week.  It would be unusual for the FOMC to make a policy change without having signaled such to the markets (which argues for no hike) but if I’m right about the Committee members themselves not having a clear sense of the likely outcome, such signaling may not have been possible this time, and a lack of such signaling may not necessarily prevent the FOMC from pulling the trigger.  While the likely outcome of next week’s FOMC meeting remains opaque to me, I will opine that if the Fed does in fact take a pass on tightening next week, I do think a rate hike at either the October or December FOMC meetings is more likely than not.

                <strong>The Hawks’ Arguments</strong>
              </p>
              
              <p>
                The case against raising rates right now is fairly well known: Inflation (at least as measured on a year-over-year basis) is below the FOMC’s target, the financial markets have been unsettled (resulting in a tightening of financial conditions even without any tightening by the Fed), a stronger dollar, and uncertainty about the global economic outlook, especially vis-à-vis China. Fair enough.  In this piece I focus on some of the arguments I expect the hawks on the Committee to employ at next week’s FOMC meeting.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker is arguably the most hawkish voting FOMC member at the moment.  Last Friday (September 4, 2015) Mr. Lacker was gracious enough to outline the hawks’ (or at least one hawk’s) position in a speech titled, “The Case Against Further Delay”.  While Mr. Lacker disclaimed that he would not make a final decision about how to vote at next week’s meeting until after he has “had the benefit of discussions with [his] colleagues” and has seen the additional data to be released prior the meeting, it is illustrative that his speech was <em>not</em> titled “The Case <em>For</em> Further Delay”.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                In his speech Mr. Lacker noted acceleration in consumer spending, recent improvements in the capex data, strong gains in nonresidential construction spending and residential investment, and tightening labor markets (Mr. Lacker delivered his speech before the release of the August employment report showing the unemployment rate dropping to 5.1% &#8211; within the FOMC’s June 2015 5.0% to 5.2% central tendency projection of NAIRU).
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Most interesting to me were Mr. Lacker’s comments on the subject of the FOMC’s +2% inflation goal.  Here’s an excerpt (bolding added be me):
              </p>
              
              <p>
                “<em>Inflation has been below that [2%] goal by varying amounts since the middle of 2012. Since January, however, the price index for personal consumption expenditures — our preferred inflation measure — has grown at an average annual rate of 2.2 percent. The core index, which excludes the more volatile food and energy components, has grown at an average rate of 1.7 percent. (You may have heard that inflation over the 12 months ending in July was 0.3 percent, but that 12-month span included the period from July 2014 to January 2015 in which inflation averaged negative 1.5 percent.) These numbers, which have been seasonally adjusted by the U.S. Department of Commerce, provide strong evidence that the transitory effects of last year’s energy prices and exchange rates are behind us.</em>
              </p>
              
              <p>
                <em>The second condition the FOMC laid out for raising interest rates was that it would have to be “reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.” <strong>The last half year of data show that inflation already has returned to our 2 percent objective. Thus both conditions that the FOMC stated earlier this year would make it appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate appear to have been met</strong></em><strong>.”</strong>
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Not that I would suspect an FOMC member of not having a firm grasp on the inflation data, but just to illustrate Mr. Lacker’s point I present Figure 1, which illustrates the 6-month annualized rate of PCE price index inflation as well as the year-over-year percentage change.  Indeed, as of July 2015 the 6-month annualized pace was +2.152% (which rounds to +2.2%) versus a 6-month annualized rate of -1.52% as of January 2015.  Thus, it is fair to note that the most-cited PCE inflation statistic – the year-over-year percentage change – was a miniscule +0.3% as of July due to an episode of temporary outright PCE price index deflation that ended six months ago.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                I calculate that if, in fact, PCE inflation runs at a +2.0% annualized pace for the <em>next</em> six months (that is, from August 2015 through January 2016) that by January 2016, the oft-cited year-over-year measure would increase to +2.08% (slightly above the Fed’s +2.0% goal).  Even many of the more dovish members of the FOMC will concede that if the Committee waits until measured inflation (and again, the preferred measure seems to be the year-over-year measure) hits its goal, the FOMC will probably have waited too long to begin the normalization process.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                That having been said, Mr. Lacker will very likely still get some pushback from other members of the FOMC regarding his assertion that the Committee’s second (inflation) condition for raising rates has in fact been met.

                What energy prices taketh away, energy prices can giveth – and then taketh away yet again.  The 6-month annualized rate of total PCE price inflation as of July 2015 of +2.15% got some help from a bounce in energy prices.  As is illustrated in Figure 2, as of July 2015 the 6-month annualized rate of the PCE price index of energy goods and services was +16.12%.  Given the recent renewed slide in crude oil and gasoline prices, energy seems likely to, once again, become a drag on the total PCE price index (at least in the August and September calculations).  Moreover, as is illustrated in Figure 3, the 6-month annualized pace on PCE price inflation ex-energy was +1.54% as of July 2015 (the year-over-year change was +1.21%).  If one strips out energy price fluctuations, the pace of inflation was still falling short of the Fed’s goal as of July 2015 – even on a 6-month annualized rate basis.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                While the pace of total PCE price inflation had in fact reached (and even slightly exceeded) the FOMC’s +2.0% goal on a 6-month annualized basis as of July, it may be a tough sell to get the more dovish members of the FOMC to agree that such is a sufficient reason to have confidence that the pace of PCE inflation will continue to run at or above the Committee’s desired pace.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                A more compelling reason (in my opinion, anyway) to have more confidence that the pace of inflation will pick up (and remain higher) over the medium term came in the form of the release of the July JOLTS (Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey) report earlier this week.  As is illustrated in Figure 4, the number of job openings surged by 430,000 in July to a record high of 5,753,000 (the data series begins as of December 2000), further widening the gap between the number of job openings and the number of hires.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                <strong>Figure 4</strong>
              </p>
              
              <p>
                <img class="alignnone  wp-image-647" src="https://heightllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/fig4a.png" alt="fig4a" width="723" height="522" />
              </p>
              
              <p>
                <strong>Figure 5</strong>
              </p>
              
              <p>
                <img class="alignnone  wp-image-648" src="https://heightllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/fig5a.png" alt="fig5a" width="732" height="529" />
              </p>
              
              <p>
                As can be seen in Figure 4, it is unusual for the number of job openings to exceed the number of hires.  Why is it happening now?  I surmise that either employers are not offering sufficient compensation to fill positions and / or that there is a mismatch between the skills required for the position and the skill sets of applicants / potential applicants.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                In the first case, wages will need to go up if the positions are to be filled.  In the second case, those with the requisite skills (who are in relatively short supply) should be able to successfully demand more pay.  Either way, it suggests a faster pace of wage inflation may well be in the offing.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Figure 5 plots the ratio of job openings to hires versus the year-over-year percentage change in average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory employees.  In general, the past relationship between the two data series strongly suggests that the pace of wage inflation will rise (presumably a precondition for a faster pace of PCE price inflation).  The puzzle is why, more recently, the pace of wage inflation has declined.  The hawks will presumably be arguing that it’s most likely a temporary aberration and the Committee should conduct policy accordingly.  The presumed response from the doves will be, “Yeah, hawks, you may well be right, but if it’s something more than just a temporary aberration we could be making a big mistake – let’s wait for more data.”
              </p>
              
              <p>
                As previously noted, which side will win this, and other, debates surrounding the question of whether next week’s meeting is the appropriate time to at least start the process of rate normalization remains elusively opaque to your author.  That said (as recently voiced by Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer) given that monetary policy acts with a lag, at some point the FOMC will have to make a leap of faith (in this case, as I see it, that at least some semblance of the Phillips curve still applies) and start raising rates before all of the data clearly illuminates just what the optimal path (and optimal timing) is.  Given the labor market data, in particular, I believe that if the FOMC judges that such a point has not yet arrived as of next week, the Committee will likely cross its collective fingers and start raising rates at one of the two subsequent FOMC meetings this year.
