## **The Takeaway**

We expect corporate tax cuts will further fuel healthcare M&A activity in 2018 with an emphasis on vertical deals involving managed care companies and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). With vertical mergers such as Humana (HUM) – Kindred (KND), CVS Health (CVS) – Aetna (AET), UnitedHealth (UNH) – DaVita (DVA), managed care organizations (MCOs) are betting on reducing spending on hospital care by keeping patients away from the hospital and better managed in the community and secondary care settings. We believe MCOs could explore additional potential acquisition targets within home health like Amedisys (AMED) and Almost Family (AFAM) as well as ambulatory assets like Surgery Partners (SGRY) in 2018. Political and market headwinds for PBMs make them attractive M&A targets as well. We predict hospitals will face difficulty consolidating in response. As merging health systems become ever larger, we expect significant challenges by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which could revisit its existing framework for reviewing the anticompetitive impact of mergers involving limited overlapping markets. <a href="/files/healthcare-mergers-and-acquisitions-the-regulatory-forces-propelling-healthcare.pdf" target="_blank">Read More ›</a>
