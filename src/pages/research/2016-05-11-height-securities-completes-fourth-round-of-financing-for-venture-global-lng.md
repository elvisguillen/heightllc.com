        <span class="xn-location">WASHINGTON</span>, <span class="xn-chron">May 11, 2016</span> /PRNewswire/ &#8212; Height Securities is pleased to announce the successful closing of a fourth round of equity financing for U.S.-based liquefied natural gas (LNG) producer Venture Global LNG, bringing the total capital raised to over <span class="xn-money">$265 million</span>. The proceeds will fund Venture Global&#8217;s development activities for its proposed export facilities in Louisiana.

        &#8220;Closing another round of financing with Venture Global LNG marks a clear indication of investors&#8217; demand for strategic midstream projects,&#8221; said <span class="xn-person">Patrick Hughes</span>, Managing Director of Height&#8217;s Investment Banking and Advisory group. &#8220;We remain bullish towards worldwide LNG demand growth, driven by the rapid expansion of certain strategic markets with numerous creditworthy counterparties and contract roll-off from traditional suppliers. We believe Venture Global is among the lowest cost, most formidable suppliers offering competitive contract pricing well below many of its non-U.S. peers. The company&#8217;s success in attracting both financing and commercial interest underscores persistent and growing demand for LNG from differentiated, low-cost, and stable supply sources like <span class="xn-location">the United States</span>.&#8221;
