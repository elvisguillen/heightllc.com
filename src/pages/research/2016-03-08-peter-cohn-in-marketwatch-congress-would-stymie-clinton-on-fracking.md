Hillary Clinton’s plans to limit fracking could quickly run dry if she wins the White House.

And Congress would be to thank, writes Height Securities analyst Peter Cohn in research note Tuesday.

Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, laid out conditions on Sunday under which she would support the controversial method of extracting oil and gas. Yet the former secretary of state suggested during her debate with challenger Bernie Sanders that she all but supports a fracking ban.

“By the time we get through all of my conditions, I do not think there will be many places in America where fracking will continue to take place,” she said at the debate in Flint, Mich.

Not so fast, writes Height Securities’ Cohn. Here’s the key line from his note: “We believe a Clinton-led executive branch would be constrained by the boundaries of existing federal law in the absence of a Democratic-controlled Congress who could potentially effect significant policy change.”

While the Senate is competitive this election season, the House appears poised to stay in Republican control, analysts have said, with Democrats picking up only a small number of seats. And that would spell trouble for some of Clinton’s plans.

Take for example what she said about opposing fracking if “the release of methane or contamination of water is present.”

On water contamination, “Clinton can’t go it alone,” Cohn writes. He says a Republican-controlled House would be unlikely to back legislation enabling a Clinton-led Environmental Protection Agency to write new rules for safe drinking water. She would have discretion to limit methane emissions, he notes, but a blanket ban on fracking where any methane release is present could only occur on federal land.

Clinton also said she is against fracking not just when any state opposes it, but any locality as well. “I don’t support it when any locality or state is against it,” she said.

But here’s the problem with that, writes Cohn: she would need Congress to act to override state laws barring local fracking bans. He calls that prospect “highly unlikely.”

Sanders’ answer to the fracking question was much shorter at the Sunday debate. “No, I do not support fracking,” he said.

Sanders’ challenge to Clinton may near the end of its run if the Vermont senator loses to her by a wide margin in Michigan’s primary on Tuesday. Polls favor the former secretary of state heading into the contest, one of four being held Tuesday.
