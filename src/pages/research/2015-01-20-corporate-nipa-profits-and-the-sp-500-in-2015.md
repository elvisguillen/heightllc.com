        <em><strong>Summary:</strong></em>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The recovery in corporate profits since the financial crisis / Great Recession has been impressive, but more recently the pace of profit growth has slowed. Based on my projection for a 4.7% annualized pace of NIPA profit growth from 3Q 2014 through 4Q 2015, the model value of the S&P 500 in 4Q 2015 would be 2056. That said, given that the relative valuation of the S&P 500 has been running around 102% in recent quarters, I’m forecasting 2100 on the S&P 500 in 4Q 2015.

                NIPA profits [or, more formally, corporate profits with inventory and capital consumption adjustments as recorded in the Bureau of Economic Analysis’ National Income and Product Account (NIPA) tables] reached an all-time high in 3Q 2014 at $2,170.7 billion (seasonally-adjusted annualized rate). As can be seen in Figure 1, the rebound in NIPA profits following the 4Q 2008 recession trough ($1,017.9 billion) has been impressive. Nevertheless, as can be seen in Figure 2, the pace of increase in NIPA profits has recently come back down to earth. The year-over-year change in NIPA profits was just +1.40% as of 3Q 2014 (down from a recent peak of 53.72% as of 4Q 2009).

                        As regular readers are aware, NIPA profits constitute the X variable in my S&P 500 valuation model. The quarterly average of the S&P 500 is the Y variable (the variable that the model is trying to “predict”); the r-square 0.975; the time periods from which the regression linear equation is derived are from 4Q 1980 through 4Q 1996 and 4Q 2002 through 1Q 2008.

                      <p>
                        Given that the NIPA profits data are always released with a lag (4Q 2014 NIPA profits data will not be released until March 27, 2015) I am always trying to estimate the current level of NIPA profits and attempting to anticipate (forecast) what the level of NIPA profits will be over the next several quarters. I’ll spare the reader all the gory details regarding how I go about making this particular bit of sausage (call me and I’ll be happy to go into it). That said, here are the most important assumptions I’ve used in formulating my NIPA profits projections:

                                  Both nominal GDP and the gross value added of domestic corporate business increase at a +5.0% annualized pace between 3Q 2014 and 4Q 2015.

                                  Net profits from the rest of the world (which have been remarkably stable over the past several years) remain unchanged at the 3Q 2014 level of $410.4 billion (annualized).

                                        These (and other lesser assumptions) result in a projection that domestic profits increase at a +5.81% annualized rate and total NIPA profits (domestic profits plus net profits from the rest of the world) increase at a +4.72% annualized rate between 3Q 2014 and 4Q 2015. Figure 3 (which also includes actual 3Q 2014 data) summarizes my projections for NIPA profits for 4Q 2014 through 4Q 2015 and also shows the model level of the S&P 500 produced by said NIPA profits projections.

                    As can be seen in Figure 3, my NIPA profits forecast results in a 4Q 2015 projection for the model level of the S&P 500 of 2055.55, a bit higher than last Friday’s closing level and a bit lower than the recent (closing) peak of 2090.57 reached on December 29, 2014. So (assuming my NIPA profit projections turn out to be correct, or are close to being correct) should we expect the S&P 500 to end 2015 somewhere around 2055? This is where it gets tricky (read: extremely hard to know / predict).

                          My NIPA profits driven S&P 500 valuation model is essentially a reversion to the mean model. As is illustrated in Figure 4 (which plots the actual quarterly average of the S&P 500 against the model level), and is arguably more clearly illustrated in Figure 5 (which plots the actual level of the S&P 500 as a percentage of the model value), while the actual level of the S&P 500 tends, over time, to revert to the “model mean”, the actual quarterly average of the S&P 500 has never been exactly at the model value. That having been said, of late it’s been darn close. In 2Q 2014 the actual level of the S&P 500 (the average closing level) was 101.30% of the model value and in 3Q 2014 the actual level of the S&P 500 was 102.07% of the model value. Based on my estimate of NIPA profits in 4Q 2014, I estimate that the actual level of the S&P 500 was 101.89% of the model value in 4Q 2014. While past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results, for my “official” forecast I am assuming that the actual level of the S&P 500 in 4Q 2015 will be 102% of the projected 4Q 2015 model value, <strong>rendering a forecast for the average closing level of the S&P 500 of 2096.66 in 4Q 2015, which I’ll simply round up to 2100.</strong>

                                Predicting the future is a hazardous endeavor and there are (obviously) both upside and downside risks to my 4Q 2015 S&P 500 forecast. First and foremost, my NIPA profit projections could be wrong. Beyond that, though, I’ll start with the downside risks, on which I will spend limited time as such are both external to the model and, presumably, are well-known to anyone likely to be reading this brief. Downside risks include (but are not limited to) the following possibilities:

                                      Upside risks external to the model include the possibility that U.S. and / or global economic growth is stronger than expected, the possibility that the Fed doesn’t end up raising rates this year (or raises rates less than expected), and the possibility that the allure of high-quality corporate equities as a store of value is heightened as market participants’ confidence in the current global monetary / currency regime erodes.

                                            The upside risk “internal” to the model is the fact that the actual level of the S&P 500 has historically often “overshot” the model value to the upside by a significant margin. The poster child for such an overshoot is the tech bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s when the actual level of the S&P 500 eventually reached 230.61% of the model value. I view this episode as an event unto itself and one that is unlikely to be repeated. That said, four other “relative valuation overshoot peaks” are identified in Figure 5 in which the actual level of the S&P 500 reached, on average, 120.39% of the model value. It is not inconceivable that such an overshoot could happen this time around, as well. If, by 4Q 2015, the actual level of the S&P 500 were to reach 120.39% of the (projected) model value (2055.55), then the actual level of the S&P 500 in 4Q 2015 would be 2474.67.

                                            While it is not inconceivable that the actual S&P 500 could climb to 120.39% of the model value this year, I am skeptical that such will actually occur for one main reason: the Fed. I believe that the Fed is going to start a tightening cycle this year and, as is illustrated in Figure 6 (on the next page), in the past when the relative valuation has approached 120% it has typically done so when the Fed was loosening (or was about to loosen) policy, not when the Fed was tightening policy. Given that the Bank of Japan has gone into QE overdrive and the European Central Bank will (presumably) announce a sovereign QE program later this week, it’s also not inconceivable that global QE could make up for or (if global QE turns out to be large enough) more than counteract Fed tightening. That having been said, I’m inclined to think that U.S. dollars matter most for U.S. equities, and only the Fed has the ability to influence the quantity of U.S. dollars in the system.
