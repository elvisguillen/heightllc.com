_“There&#8217;s just no denying what the change in that market has done to our recoveries. And it&#8217;s had a significant and material impact on our loss rates.” &#8211;_ [_Consumer_](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4063960-consumer-portfolio-services-cpss-ceo-charles-bradley-q1-2017-results-earnings-call-transcript) _Portfolio Services_

_**The Takeaway**_

_Used vehicle depreciation is only one challenge facing the auto industry. Others include regulatory inquiries into global positioning systems (GPS), kill switches, and ancillary product sales, which combine with a backdrop of credit deterioration. Last week, we_ [_reported_](http://heightllc.force.com/SingletrackCMS__DownloadDocument?docRef=45b07388-4efb-4bfe-98b1-3534f0d061c3) _that __J.D. Power Valuation Services (JDP) Used Vehicle_ [_Index_](http://img03.en25.com/Web/NADAUCG/%7B53ff782c-8d04-428b-92d5-67b2c802b6bc%7D_Used_Car_and_Light_Truck_Guidelines_201705.pdf) _6.9% year-over-year (YoY) decline compared to Black Book’s (BB) Used Vehicle Retention_ [_Index’s_](http://www.blackbook.com/black-book-index/) _decline of 5.1% YoY (Fig. 1). We have also highlighted the pullback in auto finance lending by several major banks driven by increasing losses. Increased regulatory scrutiny of product sales and repossession tools could further inhibit lending. We are focused on the trends that will continue to build in 2017 and exert downward pressure on used vehicle valuations. These trends include 1) record levels of off-lease volumes in 2017, 2018, and 2019; 2) used car volumes constraining auction capacity in 2017 and exceeding it in 2018 and 2019; 3) tighter credit underwriting standards (Wells Fargo &#8211; **WFC**, TCF Financial &#8211; **TCF**, Consumer Portfolio Services &#8211; **CPSS**);__4) new car incentives nearing historical peaks; and 5) the number of days new vehicles “sit” on dealers’ lots is the highest since 2009. The combination of lower used car auction prices and weakening credit quality will manifest in the operations of auto finance companies with subprime lending concentrations, including Credit Acceptance Corp (**CACC**), Santander Consumer (**SC**), Ally Financial (**ALLY**), and Capital One Financial (**COF**). For more information on used car pricing trends, please see our_ [_May 26_](http://heightllc.force.com/SingletrackCMS__DownloadDocument?docRef=45b07388-4efb-4bfe-98b1-3534f0d061c3)_,_ [_May 17_](http://heightllc.force.com/SingletrackCMS__DownloadDocument?docRef=9c02ba16-e894-4079-a6ed-a253c98fd880)_,_ [_May 10_](http://heightllc.force.com/SingletrackCMS__DownloadDocument?docRef=ef944338-493a-40d3-a86d-40ce07468e3a)_,_ [_April 19_](http://heightllc.force.com/SingletrackCMS__DownloadDocument?docRef=32ef30b0-a3df-4de7-b328-5cd58cbba35e)_, and_ [_April 12_](http://heightllc.force.com/SingletrackCMS__DownloadDocument?docRef=0bb66ff6-3d6b-4774-8fa4-789e59671e97) _reports._

  * **Used car values continue their downward slide.** Both the JDP and BB indices are down YTD and YoY. The JDP index shown prices down YTD by more than 4% in February, March and April, which are the strongest months from a used car price perspective. As the market enters the seasonally weaker period, we expect the indices will show declines of 6-7% in 2017 and possibly greater.
  * **BB weekly data indicates average decline YTD.** The weekly data shows used car prices down 4.2% as of May 19 (11.0% annualized) and used truck prices down 4.6% (12.0% annualized). The key issue is that prices continued to decline at the average rate during the seasonally strong period.  If prices can only maintain average declines in a strong season, that indicates used car price declines are set to accelerate for the balance of 2017. We combined the 2017 YTD price declines with the decline in prices from May 13 to December 31, 2016 of 16.3%. This suggests that average used car prices will be down 20.5% in 2017, assuming the price change for the balance of 2017 tracks the changes that occurred in 2016. We view the risks in the used car market as elevated and expect the decline in prices will be above 20.5%.
  * **JDP monthly data shows a similar trend.** JDP monthly data shows average used car prices have declined by 1.9% through April (Figure 3). This is an annualized rate of 5.7%, well below average annual deprecation estimates; however, this data has also been down in every month of 2017. In addition, the decline of 1.9% is 30 basis points higher than the 1.6% decline registered through April 2016. This supports our view that price declines in 2017 are set to exceed 2016 declines.
  * **Depreciation is running above average.** Annual used vehicle depreciation estimates vary with Edmunds estimating 12% and Black Book (BB) estimating 18%. Using Black Book’s weekly Market Insights, we estimate the annualized YTD price change for cars to be 11% and 12% for trucks; however, YoY, cars have depreciated 19.8% and trucks by 16.9% (Figure 5). The above-average annual depreciation in used cars is the reason the Black Book’s index is down YTD and YoY.
  * **Off-lease vehicle volumes set to hit multi-year highs.  **Off-lease vehicle volumes will be a record3.6 million units in 2017, and the number is [expected](http://www.autoremarketing.com/financial-services/gm-financial-see-1-million-lease-units-next-3-years) to continue increasing until it peaks at 4.6 million units in 2020. We expect off-lease volumes to result in above-average annual depreciation in 2017 and 2018.
  * **Auto credit quality is deteriorating. ** CPSS’s 1Q17 credit quality commentary supports reports from the [Federal Reserve Bank of New York,](http://newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/blog/2016/LSE_2016q3_new-autos-scally_data) [Fitch,](http://www.autofinancenews.net/auto-abs-delinquencies-reach-20-year-high-fitch-says/) and S&P highlighting credit weakness in the auto lending sector, notably in subprime credits. Wells Fargo (**WFC**) reported that “there was an expected decline in auto loans from the fourth quarter as continued proactive steps to tighten underwriting standards resulted in lower origination volume.” A significant reduction in auto credit could cause used car prices to step down. This could happen in 2017 or 2018, if credit trends continue to deteriorate.
  * **New car sales timeline is increasing.** The American International Automobile Dealers Association [reported](http://www.aiada.org/news/press-releases/auto-sales-lose-momentum-heading-spring) the “average length of time a car sat on a dealer’s lot hit 70 days in March – the longest stretch of time since July 2009.” The increased inventory levels will likely keep incentives high.
  *  **New vehicle incentives are elevated. ** Incentives are 10.4% of a new vehicle’s MSRP, [according](http://www.jdpower.com/cars/articles/auto-sales/march-us-new-auto-sales-uptick-primed-robust-rebates) toJ.D. Power. This is the highest level since 2009 when incentives hit 11.4%. Incentives are likely to remain high to move inventories that are building on dealers’ lots.
  * **Conclusion. ** Black Book’s Used Vehicle Retention [Index](http://www.blackbook.com/black-book-index/) is down 5.1%  year-over-year (Figure 1).  This level of price depreciation is in line with several forecasts, including the one used by Ally Financial (**ALLY**); however, the seasonally strong period of used car prices has now ended. Pressure on used car prices from higher interest rates, credit normalization, and off-lease volumes will likely take the helm for the balance of 2017 and pressure used vehicle prices at a pace that exceeds industry expectations.

**Regulatory scrutiny could inhibit auto lending.** Earlier this year, CACC reported that the Federal Trade Commission began a civil investigation and [requested](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/19/business/dealbook/gps-devices-car-loans.html?mcubz=0&_r=0) information on the company’s policies, practices and procedures related to so-called GPS starter interrupter devices (SID). The FTC’s investigation into the use of these repossession tools resulted in SC [announcing](https://www.dallasnews.com/business/autos/2017/02/24/dallas-auto-finance-giant-stop-using-gps-tracking-ignition-kill-switches-repo-cars) it would stop using them.

Both Fitch and S&P have reported that subprime delinquencies and losses have increased in 2017. Lenders that cease using GPS and SIDs will likely see these metrics increase further as it will take longer to repossess a vehicle. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s (CFPB) Automobile Finance Examination Procedures directs examiners to review the use of SIDs and how the auto loan servicers disclose the use of SIDs to consumers, if the use of a SID is appropriate, and the policies and procedures for using SIDs.  The manual also highlights the use of GPS systems.

The issue of income verification has also been [raised](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-22/subprime-auto-giant-checked-income-on-just-8-of-loans-in-abs) by Moody’s Investor Service in SC’s auto securitizations. In March, SC [entered](https://www.ft.com/content/a8b9e4a0-62ad-3680-a655-99de92be1af4) into settlements with the states of Massachusetts and Delaware. SC was accused of violating consumer-protection laws with regard to its underwriting practices and car dealer management between 2009 and 2014. Issues concerned inflating borrowers’ incomes and vehicle values as well as selling ancillary products. The CFPB’s examination procedures require an evaluation of underwriting practices, including evidence of false or undocumented income. At present, it is unclear if the CFPB will seek to implement an income verification or an ability-to-repay (ATR) requirement for auto lenders. However, the prospect of such an action will increase if more lenders are found to be inflating borrowers’ incomes.

The manual also discusses the sales of ancillary products, such as guaranteed auto protection (GAP) insurance, extended warranties, and vehicle add-on products (i.e. Lo-Jack systems and paint protection). At the May 15 Auto Finance Risk and Compliance Summit, CFPB Deputy Assistant Director for Originations Calvin Hagins [stated](http://www.autofinancenews.net/regulators-step-up-scrutiny-of-ancillary-products/) that lenders should expect to receive questions on the sales of ancillary products. He specifically stated that the CFPB will focus on how the product is offered to the consumer, at what state in the process it is offered, how the disclosures are being provided to the consumer, and the acceptance rate. He made it clear that a 95% acceptance rate on an optional product will receive additional scrutiny. The FTC is also [focused](https://www.consumerfinancemonitor.com/2017/05/18/cfpb-and-ftc-confirm-scrutiny-of-ancillary-products/?utm_source=Ballard%2BSpahr%2BLLP%2B-%2BConsumer%2BFinance%2BMonitor&utm_campaign=fa07f10172-RSS_EMAIL_CAMPAIGN&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_6dc018fe4c-fa07f10172-72558245) on ancillary product sales. The FTC is focused on tactics that pressure consumers into purchasing these products in order to obtain financing for the vehicle.

If pressure from the CFPB and FTC result in fewer ancillary product sales, it would reduce the profit margin for auto dealers. This could result in reduced sales (i.e. profit targets not achieved) or down-selling consumers into lower priced, higher margin vehicles. In either case, these actions could contribute to additional downward pressure on used vehicle prices.
