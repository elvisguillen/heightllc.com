The Takeaway:

_Used vehicle depreciation is only one challenge facing the auto industry. Others include regulatory inquiries into global positioning systems (GPS), kill switches, and ancillary product sales, which combine with a backdrop of credit deterioration. Last week, we _[_reported_](http://heightllc.force.com/SingletrackCMS__DownloadDocument?docRef=45b07388-4efb-4bfe-98b1-3534f0d061c3)_ that J.D. Power Valuation Services (JDP) Used Vehicle _[_Index_](http://img03.en25.com/Web/NADAUCG/%7B53ff782c-8d04-428b-92d5-67b2c802b6bc%7D_Used_Car_and_Light_Truck_Guidelines_201705.pdf)_ 6.9% year-over-year (YoY) decline compared to Black Book’s (BB) Used Vehicle Retention _[_Index’s_](http://www.blackbook.com/black-book-index/)_ decline of 5.1% YoY (Fig. 1). We have also highlighted the pullback in auto finance lending by several major banks driven by increasing losses. Increased regulatory scrutiny of product sales and repossession tools could further inhibit lending. We are focused on the trends that will continue to build in 2017 and exert downward pressure on used vehicle valuations. These trends include 1) record levels of off-lease volumes in 2017, 2018, and 2019; 2) used car volumes constraining auction capacity in 2017 and exceeding it in 2018 and 2019; 3) tighter credit underwriting standards (Wells Fargo &#8211; **WFC**, TCF Financial &#8211; **TCF**, Consumer Portfolio Services &#8211; **CPSS**); 4) new car incentives nearing historical peaks; and 5) the number of days new vehicles “sit” on dealers’ lots is the highest since 2009. The combination of lower used car auction prices and weakening credit quality will manifest in the operations of auto finance companies with subprime lending concentrations, including Credit Acceptance Corp (**CACC**), Santander Consumer (**SC**), Ally Financial (**ALLY**), and Capital One Financial (**COF**).
