      </p>
      
      <p>
        The enactment of the ACA in 2010 fundamentally altered the regulatory landscape for the healthcare sector and spurred significant changes to the manner in which providers deliver care and payers compensate care delivery. As the law has become inextricably ingrained in the healthcare system, it is incumbent upon healthcare providers, especially hospitals, to adapt or risk falling behind as the business of healthcare continues its rapid transition. We have identified eleven trends spurred by the ACA and its aftermath that are forcing changes to care delivery and compensation. This report examines these trends and projects the impact on the hospital sector.

                <strong>We have identified eleven trends </strong>spurred by the ACA and its aftermath that are forcing change in the way care is delivered and compensated. This report examines these trends and projects the impact on the hospital sector:
              </p>

              </p>
              
              <p>
                Taken in aggregate, these Top 11 trends signal that the nation’s healthcare system is undergoing a fundamental and irreversible change that hospitals and other providers must adapt to in order to survive and thrive. We posit that these trends will result in the following five outcomes:
              </p>
              
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
                <strong>Hospitals will no longer be able to grow only by increasing volumes</strong>. Rather, hospitals and other providers will need to be smart and strategic to respond to these trends and grow by improving quality of care throughout the care continuum.
              </p>
              
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
                <strong>Investors no longer can look at the hospital sector generally and expect it to rise and fall in lockstep</strong>. Rather, it is imperative to recognize that there will be winners and losers; those that make the fundamental investments necessary to respond to these changes will succeed while those that do not will struggle.
              </p>
              
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
                <strong>The strong are likely to get stronger while smaller hospitals and non-adapters will fall by the wayside</strong>. This presents an opportunity for adapters to expand market share and for consolidation to thrive. This continues a recent trend that has been in effect since the passage of the ACA.
              </p>
              
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
                <strong>For-profit hospitals are competing on the national landscape with large non-profit hospital systems</strong> such as Geisinger, Intermountain, Kaiser, Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, and others that have grown significantly since the passage of the ACA and, generally speaking, are much farther ahead in adapting to the ACA. It will be important for the for-profits to invest in the resources necessary to be able to thrive in this new environment.
              </p>
              
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
                <strong>Unaffiliated community hospitals are likely to struggle to remain solvent</strong> in this new environment, which could lead to commensurate debt issues. We expect that the debt markets could offer opportunities to investors.
              </p>

                <strong>Introduction & Background</strong>
              </p>
              
              <p>
                The enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010 fundamentally altered the regulatory landscape of the healthcare sector and spurred significant changes to the manner in which providers deliver care and payers compensate care delivery. With the 2014 simultaneous coming on line of the health insurance marketplaces and the state option to expand Medicaid, the impact of the ACA has further intensified and spurred a secondary wave of care delivery and payment trends. As the law has become ingrained in the healthcare system, many of these trends are now almost certainly irreversible. It is incumbent upon healthcare providers, especially hospitals, to adapt or risk falling behind as the business of healthcare continues its rapid transition.

                1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rise of the High-Deductible Health Coverage Plan</span>
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Cost-sharing requirements for beneficiaries have increased significantly since the passage of the ACA and represent what we believe to be the most critical challenge to hospitals in the post-ACA environment. The root cause of this trend is that commercial payers have had to adapt to the law’s various consumer protections regarding the sale and provision of health benefits, including: standardization of essential health benefits and qualified health plans; medical loss ratio (MLR) requirements; prohibition on annual and lifetime limits, rescission, and exclusion for pre-existing illness; requirement of guaranteed issue and guaranteed renewal; limits on the variance of premiums charged within a service area; and increased state and federal overview of annual premium adjustments. In order to compete and remain profitable in this environment, payers increasingly are marketing plans with low premiums and high cost-sharing requirements, in particular high deductibles. Increased cost-sharing requirements and high-deductible plans are now commonplace on the individual market (i.e., the health benefits exchanges established by the ACA), in employer-sponsored insurance (ESI), and in Medicare Advantage (MA) plans. Additionally, several conservative-leaning states have decided to implement Medicaid expansion through Section 1115 waivers and require increased cost sharing for the expansion population.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                High-deductible plans are most common on the health exchanges, especially in Bronze-level and Silver-level plans, the two most popular levels sold on the exchanges. According to U.S. Department of Health and Human Service <a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/pdf-document/health-insurance-marketplace-2015-open-enrollment-period-march-enrollment-report">data</a>, of the 11.7 million Americans that selected an insurance plan through a federally-facilitated or state-based exchange during the 2015 open enrollment period, approximately 22 percent selected a Bronze plan and 67 percent selected a Silver plan. The Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) reviewed all of the plans sold on the exchanges and <a href="http://kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/the-cost-of-care-with-marketplace-coverage/">found</a> that the average Bronze plan has a deductible of over $5,300 for individual coverage and over $10,600 for family coverage; the average Silver plan has a deductible of over $2,500 for individual coverage and over $5,100 for family coverage. While certain lower-income individuals that select a Silver plan are eligible for cost-sharing subsidies, our <a href="https://heightview.protectedpdf.com/wTDMCd">February 19</a> commentary estimates that approximately one-half of all Silver plan enrollees have no or negligible cost-sharing assistance.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                High-deductible plans have become increasingly commonplace in ESI since the passage of the ACA, too. According to a <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhis/earlyrelease/insur201508.pdf">recently released report</a> by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the percentage of persons under age 65 with private ESI coverage who were enrolled in a high-deductible plan increased by over 55 percent between 2010 and 2014, from 23.3 percent to 36.2 percent. (A “high-deductible plan” is defined as self-only coverage with an annual deductible of at least $1,300 and family coverage of with an annual deductible of at least $2,600.) Nearly 64 percent of all such individuals with a high-deductible plan do not have a health savings account (HSA) to cover cost-sharing requirements, according to the NCHS survey. KFF’s <a href="http://files.kff.org/attachment/2014-employer-health-benefits-survey-full-report">2014 annual survey</a> of employer health benefits supports the CDC’s data; KFF found that the average deductible for ESI is now over $1,200, that 41 percent of covered workers were enrolled in a plan with an annual deductible of over $1,000 for single-coverage in 2014 (up from just 10 percent in 2006) and that 18 percent were enrolled in a plan with an annual deductible of over $2,000 for single coverage in 2014 (up from just 3 percent in 2006). Typically, deductibles for family coverage are double that of individual coverage.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Looking ahead, ESI is likely to move even more forcefully towards high-deductible plans as the so-called “Cadillac tax” becomes effective in 2018. This non-deductible excise tax included in the ACA will charge insurers and/or self-insured employers a 40 percent fee for every dollar over a pre-determined threshold in annual employee and employer contributions to monthly premiums. A Towers Watson (TW) <a href="http://www.towerswatson.com/en/Press/2014/09/nearly-half-us-employers-to-hit-health-care-cadillac-tax-in-2018-with-82-percent-by-2023">analysis</a> found that 48 percent of employers are likely to trigger the tax in 2018, rising to 82 percent in 2023 due to the low inflationary adjuster for the threshold.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Increased cost sharing is becoming more prevalent in Medicare and Medicaid, too, especially in MA and certain state Medicaid plans. According to KFF <a href="http://kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/medicare-advantage-2015-spotlight-enrollment-market-update/">data</a>, the average out-of-pocket limit for enrollees in MA plans has increased by 16.7 percent over the past three years, from $4,296 in 2012 to $5,014 in 2015. In addition, as discussed above, conservative-leaning states have elected to expand Medicaid coverage through 1115 waivers that require increased cost-sharing requirements for beneficiaries above federal limits.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                This rise in cost-sharing and high-deductible plans is critically important to hospitals because persons with increased cost-sharing requirements utilize fewer health services (even necessary preventive care) and hospitals face great difficulty in collecting deductibles, coinsurance, and copays, which can negatively affect a hospital’s bad debt. According to an <a href="http://images.info.truvenhealth.biz/Web/TruvenHealthAnalytics/%7B9c165d86-ecc0-4030-96ef-23bc5fb6158b%7D_HP_15435_0415_CDHP_RB.pdf">analysis</a> by Truven Health Analytics, over a three-year study period (2009 – 2012) persons with high-deductible plans were found to spend, on average, $457 &#8211; $532 per member per year (PMPY) less than a matched cohort without high-deductible plans. About 75 percent of that total was attributable to lower utilization rates by the high-deductible cohort, which were 2 – 11 percent lower across various services.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Collections is an increasingly problematic challenge for hospitals. <em>Modern Healthcare</em> <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB4QFjAAahUKEwjx4JXZysDHAhXMOT4KHQjvAKc&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.modernhealthcare.com%2Farticle%2F20150624%2FNEWS%2F150629941&ei=e3XaVbG3Jczz-AGI3oO4Cg&usg=AFQjCNGI1SrzAvoivjMH3ltHxH9J50FXhw">reports</a> that at the June annual National Institute meeting of the Healthcare Financial Management Association (HFMA), Mr. Christopher Kerns, Managing Director of the Advisory Board Company, told the audience that healthcare providers are collecting only $0.18 &#8211; $0.34 on the dollar from patients with high-deductible plans and that once a bill exceeds 5 percent of household income, the patient’s ability to pay drops to nearly zero. This data becomes more alarming when one considers that the average deductible for Bronze-level family coverage is nearly equivalent to the average cost per hospital stay, meaning that it is plausible that a hospital might collect nothing for the provision of care to such persons despite the fact that such patients are nominally “insured.” The 2014 <a href="http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/statbriefs.jsp">report</a> from the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) finds that the mean hospital cost per stay in 2012 was $10,400. This breaks out to $21,200 for surgical stays, $8,500 for medical stays, and $4,300 for maternal and neonatal stays.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Looking ahead, we expect this trend towards high-deductible plans to continue and to cause a commensurate uptick in hospital bad debt. Some data and anecdotal reports indicate that bad debt is already increasing. A <a href="http://www.kyha.com/2015/05/11/kha-releases-new-report-outlining-financial-challenges-facing-kentucky-hospitals/">report</a> from the Kentucky Hospital Association found that bad debt increased for that state’s hospitals by 28 percent from 2009 to 2013 and is expected to grow by an additional 60 percent by 2020. During its 2Q earnings conference call, HCA discussed its slight uptick in bad debt and partially attributed this to rising deductibles and cost-sharing requirements.
              </p>
              
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
                2.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Value-Based Purchasing: Shift from Paying for Volume to Paying for Quality</span>
              </p>
              
              <p>
                The ACA has spurred the beginnings of a transformation of the healthcare system from paying for volume to paying for quality. The Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (<a href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/AcuteInpatientPPS/Readmissions-Reduction-Program.html">HRRP</a>), the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing (<a href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/hospital-value-based-purchasing/index.html">VBP</a>) Program, and the Hospital Acquired Conditions (<a href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/AcuteInpatientPPS/HAC-Reduction-Program.html">HAC</a>) Reduction Program all are designed to penalize hospitals that fail to meet certain predetermined quality metrics by reducing their Medicare reimbursement rate. (Hospitals that perform well in the VBP program are rewarded for their good performance.) Congress and CMS have also implemented a value-based purchasing program for skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and have implemented payment-for-quality provisions into the physician fee schedule as part of the permanent fix to the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR).
              </p>
              
              <p>
                The ACA also implemented the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) – an accountable care organization (ACO) initiative within the Medicare program – and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (Innovation Center) to oversee a variety of pilots and demonstration programs that test pay-for-quality initiatives. Over 300 provider groups currently participate in the MSSP and over 2,000 providers (including over 420 hospitals) participate in the Bundled Payments for Care Initiative (BPCI), the largest CMMI project.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Recently, policymakers have doubled-down on their push toward VBP. HHS announced last year that it intends to significantly increase the percentage of Medicare payments that are subject to quality performance. Since that time, two compulsory pay-for-quality programs have been proposed in regulation by CMS: the Home Health Value Based Purchasing Model and the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CCJR) Model. In both instances, CMS is holding providers financially responsible for quality of care and patient outcomes; unlike previous payment models proposed in regulation by CMS, these initiatives compel providers residing in pre-selected regions to participate. We would note that the stakes are increasing with these programs: the HHVPB Model proposes to place 8 percent of home health payments at risk (this is 4x the amount at risk in the hospital VBP program) and the CCJR will hold hospitals financially responsible for the care provided to patients after they are discharged to PAC sites of care.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Private payers are beginning to follow CMS’s lead. In January 2015, the Health Care Transformation Task Force (HCTTF), a consortium of 20 large payers including Aetna (AET), committed to have 75 percent of their respective businesses operating under value-based contracts payment arrangements by January 2020. Looking ahead, we believe that the healthcare system is on an inexorable march away from fee-for-service and towards fee-for-quality.
              </p>
              
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
                3. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Transference of Care from Inpatient to Outpatient Settings</span>
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Over the past decade, hospital-provided care has shifted steadily from the inpatient to the outpatient setting. Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) <a href="http://medpac.gov/documents/reports/chapter-3-hospital-inpatient-and-outpatient-services-(march-2015-report).pdf?sfvrsn=0">data</a> indicates that from 2006 – 2013, Medicare inpatient discharges per beneficiary declined by 17 percent while outpatient visits per beneficiary increased by 33 percent. (About one-third of the outpatient services growth in 2013 is due to a 10 percent increase in the number of evaluation and management (E&M) visits billed as outpatient services as hospitals purchase freestanding physician practices and convert them to hospital outpatient departments (HOPDs). MedPAC is closely watching this trend and President Obama proposed in his FY16 budget document to impose site neutrality between E&M services provided in a HOPD and a physician practice). Much of this transfer from inpatient to outpatient is driven by technological changes that make it increasingly possible to perform on an outpatient basis complex procedures previously done in an inpatient setting.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                This shift towards outpatient care has financial repercussions for hospitals as inpatient services are typically more profitable. The Medicare payment per beneficiary for inpatient admissions is over $3,000 while the payment per beneficiary for outpatient services is less than $1,500, or about 46 percent of the inpatient payment per beneficiary. We also note that the average payment per discharge for a Medicare beneficiary in an acute care hospital is about $11,450 while the average payment per hospital outpatient service for a Medicare beneficiary is $257. We expect the transference from inpatient to outpatient settings to continue and for policymakers to closely watch the conversion of freestanding physician practices to HOPDs.
              </p>
              
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
                4. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Downward Pressure on Reimbursements</span>
              </p>
              
              <p>
                The ACA implemented several changes to Medicare payment formulas that have resulted in declining reimbursements for hospitals and other providers in actual terms. According to MedPAC <a href="http://medpac.gov/documents/reports/chapter-3-hospital-inpatient-and-outpatient-services-(march-2015-report).pdf?sfvrsn=0">data</a>, Medicare margins for hospitals in 2013 were -5.4 percent. (We note that for-profit hospitals had Medicare margins of 1.2 percent, significantly higher than their non-profit counterparts due to lower costs and a better patient mix.) MedPAC indicates that all-payer margins for hospitals in 2013 rose to the highest level in many years due largely to 5 – 6 percent increases in private payer prices per data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the Health Care Cost Institute (HCCI).
              </p>
              
              <p>
                While Medicare rates are expected to continue to come under pressure from the formula changes implemented by the ACA and subsequent legislation, we also expect private rates to come under pressure too as commercial insurers attempt to rebalance their leverage with providers. The announced plans for Aetna (AET) to acquire Humana (HUM) and Anthem (ANTM) for Cigna (CI), if they are permitted to proceed by the Department of Justice, would provide payers with significantly greater leverage in price negotiations.

                5. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Risk-Sharing: ACOs and Other New Payment Models</span>
              </p>
              
              <p>
                As discussed above, the MSSP and other new payment models are designed to place greater financial risk on hospitals and other providers for the care provided to patients. Historically, providers have received payment for services provided while the full financial risk rested with payers. ACOs and comparable models transfer risk to the provider, providing bonuses for providing quality care that is less expensive than a benchmark and requiring punitive payment penalties for failure to meet such benchmarks. We expect these models to continue to proliferate as public and private payers seek to shift greater risk on to providers.

                6. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Health Information Technology: Interoperable EHR Systems are Paramount</span>
              </p>
              
              <p>
                The HITECH Act has <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms/Downloads/July2015_SummaryReport.pdf">provided</a> over 4,800 hospitals with more than $18.6 billion in aggregate Medicare and Medicaid payments to purchase electronic health records (EHRs) and other health information technology (HIT). These payments have sunset and beginning in FY15, hospitals that fail to demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technologies will receive a negative payment adjustment to their annual market basket for the inpatient prospective payment system. Looking ahead, it is imperative that hospitals maintain highly functioning EHRs that are interoperable and can support the data collection, analysis, and reporting required by public and private payers and facilitate the integrated care models spurred by the ACA and its aftermath.

                7. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Trans-Provider Integration: The Importance of Post-Acute Care</span>
              </p>
              
              <p>
                As discussed previously, many hospitals are increasingly purchasing freestanding physician practices. We note that many for-profit hospitals, such as HCA and Tenet (THC) are purchasing ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs) in order to diversify into outpatient care services. We expect this trend to continue and to expand into PAC settings. As ACOs and ACO-like models proliferate, it will become increasingly important for hospitals to be able to control patient care post-discharge. The recently announced CCJR model from CMS demonstrates that the agency is moving towards holding hospitals directly financially responsible for the care provided to their patients after discharge. It will be incumbent upon acute care hospitals to engage more directly with PAC providers and perhaps to formally integrate PAC care into a comprehensive continuum of care for patients.

                8. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Transition to Managed Care Models in Medicare and Medicaid</span>
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Both the Medicare and Medicaid programs are increasingly transitioning to a managed care model, which could have repercussions for hospitals. According to a KFF <a href="https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/8749-figure-1.png">analysis</a> of Medicare enrollment data, the percentage of Medicare beneficiaries receiving services through a MA plan has increased from 13 percent in 2005 to 31 percent in 2015, a jump of 138.5 percent in just one decade. We believe that this trend is very likely to continue for several reasons. MA plans remain profitable even as payments have come into line with FFS per the ACA and there are no additional payment reductions on the horizon. The Baby Boomers, becoming eligible for Medicare, are very comfortable with managed care and likely will gravitate towards the additional benefits offered by MA plans that are unavailable through traditional Medicare. MedPAC recently has begun to highlight the ability of MA to help drive payment reform because it offers an integrated care model that is less fractured that traditional Medicare. Finally, as MA participation has grown, an increasing number of lawmakers have become supportive of the program, meaning we believe that the political support for MA may have passed a tipping point.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                The Medicaid program is also moving away from FFS and towards managed care. According to <a href="https://www.macpac.gov/publication/percentage-of-medicaid-enrollees-in-managed-care-by-state-and-eligibility-group/">MACPAC data</a>, about one-half of Medicaid beneficiaries now receive coverage through a comprehensive risk-based managed care plan. Just 20 years ago, only 5 percent of Medicaid beneficiaries received services in this manner. States are increasingly moving towards the managed care model because it offloads risk onto commercial payers.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                In general, it is believed that MA and Medicaid MCO provider rates are relatively comparable to Medicare and Medicaid FFS rates. However, generally speaking, managed care companies have greater incentive and more tools to control utilization. MA plans and MCOs receive a capitated rate, which makes utilization the key to profitability. Looking ahead, hospitals may face new challenges as MA plans and Medicaid MCOs seek to limit provider networks and/or patient access to care as part of a broader strategy to control utilization and costs.

                9. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Outsourcing of Emergency Department, Hospitalist, and Other Services</span>
              </p>
              
              <p>
                A number of hospitals are outsourcing their EDs and other services in an effort to reduce labor costs, streamline operations, and simplify the delivery of services. EDs are capital intensive and usually are loss-leaders for hospitals, though they remain critically important to hospital operations as over 70 percent of inpatient admission originate in the ED.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                TeamHealth (TMH) and Envision Healthcare (EVHC) are leading outsourcers that provide a variety of services to acute care hospitals, e.g., ED, ambulance, anesthesia, and hospitalist. As more acute care hospitals seek to offload these services, we anticipate that outsourcers will benefit.

                10. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coverage Expansion: Exchanges and Medicaid</span>
              </p>
              
              <p>
                The ACA’s coverage expansion through the health benefits exchanges and Medicaid expansion is a tailwind for the hospitals. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/43900-2015-03-ACAtables.pdf">projects</a> that the number of persons purchasing coverage through the exchanges will grow from about 11 million in 2015 to over 24 million by 2017 before settling to about 22 million persons by 2025.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                With regard to Medicaid expansion, we believe that every state will eventually expand their Medicaid program to cover non-disabled, non-elderly, childless adults up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, though it will take time. We do not anticipate that any additional states will expand Medicaid in the next several months since most state legislatures are out of session until 2016 and many states are just emerging from vicious political fights over expansion (e.g., Florida). Indeed, due to the election in 2016, little action is likely to happen on this front until 2017. However, by 2018, we expect that most states will expand Medicaid in some form.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                In fact, Medicaid expansion is more or less on track with the rate of uptake of the original Medicaid program 50 years ago. President Lyndon Johnson signed the Medicaid statute into law in July 1965 and states could begin to draw down federal funds for their Medicaid programs in January 1966. According to data from KFF, 26 states implemented Medicaid as of January 1967 (one year after the start) and 11 more (37 total) implemented Medicaid as of January 1968 (two years after the start). We would note that the seven states that did not accept Medicaid dollars until January 1970, four years after such funding was made available, were Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Mississippi, New Jersey, and North Carolina, which is very similar to the list of modern-day holdouts. By January 1970, all but two states had implemented Medicaid (Alaska and Arizona).
              </p>
              
              <p>
                ACA Medicaid-expansion dollars only became available starting in January 2014, so we are just 18 months into this experiment. At a comparable time in the original Medicaid roll-out (July 1967), only 32 of 50 states plus DC had set up Medicaid programs. There are currently <a href="https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/current-status-of-the-medicaid-expansion-decisions-healthreform.png">31 states</a> with Medicaid expansion programs through the ACA. There will be outliers, of course; Alaska did not accept the original Medicaid until January 1972 and Arizona did not create a Medicaid program until October 1982, and when they did, it was a very narrow program that was created through an 1115 waiver. We would expect Texas to be a holdout on Medicaid expansion, but it likely will be an outlier.

                11. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Structural Decline in Utilization: No Return to the Bad Old Days</span>
              </p>
              
              <p>
                National Health Expenditure (NHE) <a href="http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/NationalHealthAccountsHistorical.html">data</a> demonstrates that healthcare spending post-ACA declined precipitously from an average annual growth rate of 6.32% in 2004-2008 to 3.86% in 2009-2013, a drop of 39%. While this deceleration corresponds with the passage of the ACA, the reasons for the slowdown are varied and debatable, with most observers crediting the overall slowdown in the economy. The ACA generally is credited with being a contributing factor to the slowdown in Medicare spending, which accounts for 20% of NHE. A <a href="http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/early/2014/11/25/hlthaff.2014.1107">report</a> published in <em>Health Affairs</em> posits that the payment reductions implemented in fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare and Medicare Advantage by the ACA likely combined with slower enrollment growth, flat per-enrollee growth as relatively younger Baby Boomers join the program, slower increases in hospital outpatient utilization and a decline in the volume and intensity of physician services to hold Medicare growth to just 3.4% in 2013. Budget sequestration, which requires an annual 2.0% reduction in aggregate Medicare expenditures through 2024, is thought also to play a significant role in the deceleration of NHE.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Recent data seems to indicate that cost trends are increasing as spending is estimated to have increased by 5.6 percent in 2014. However, healthcare spending is not anticipated to return to pre-ACA growth rates. A recent <a href="http://www.urban.org/research/publication/has-faster-health-care-spending-growth-returned?elq_cid=1672314&x_id=">study</a> by the Urban Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation states that “there does not yet appear to be evidence of an underlying spike in health spending … [and] the recent bump can be explained by the ACA coverage expansion.” Thus, we believe that this supports our contention that the ACA implemented structural changes that will prevent health spending from growing at pre-ACA rates.

                <strong>Impact on Hospitals</strong>
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Taken in aggregate, these Top 11 trends signal that the nation’s healthcare system is undergoing a fundamental and irreversible change that hospitals and other providers must adapt to in order to survive and thrive. We posit that these trends will result in the following five outcomes:
              </p>
              
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
                1. Hospitals will no longer be able to grow only by increasing volumes. Rather, hospitals and other providers will need to be smart and strategic to respond to these trends and to grow by improving quality of care throughout the care continuum.
              </p>
              
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
                2. Investors no longer can look at the hospital sector generally and expect it to rise and fall in lockstep. Rather, it is imperative to recognize that there will be winners and losers; those that make the fundamental investments necessary to respond to these changes will succeed while those that do not will struggle.
              </p>
              
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
                3. The strong are likely to get stronger while smaller hospitals and non-adapters will fall by the wayside. This presents an opportunity for adapters to expand market share and for consolidation to thrive. This continues a recent trend that has been in effect since the passage of the ACA, as indicated by MedPAC <a href="http://medpac.gov/documents/reports/chapter-3-hospital-inpatient-and-outpatient-services-(march-2015-report).pdf?sfvrsn=0">data</a>.
              </p>
              
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
                4. For-profit hospitals are competing on the national landscape with large non-profit hospital systems such as Geisinger, Intermountain, Kaiser, Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, and others that have grown significantly since the passage of the ACA and, generally speaking, are much farther ahead in adapting. It will be important for the for-profits to invest in the resources necessary to be able to thrive in this new environment.
              </p>
              
              <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
                5. Unaffiliated community hospitals are likely to struggle to remain solvent in this new environment, which could lead to commensurate debt issues. We expect that the debt markets could offer opportunities to savvy investors.
